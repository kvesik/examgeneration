55466	Transcription	easy	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 3	Explain why people might legitimately disagree about how many sounds this particular word contains.\\~\\<rice>~\\ 				
55466	Phonological Features	medium	Quiz 3, Question 3	Explain why this featural specification either does or does not match the given sound.\\~\\{[-consonantal]}, {[+sonorant]}~\\{[h]}~\\ 				
55466	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Homework 1, Question 3(a)	Could this image be the result of producing the sound represented by the given IPA symbol? Why or why not?\\~\\{[t͡ʃ]}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/staticpalatography_fricative.png} \end{figure}~\\	staticpalatography_fricative.png			
55466	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\

84480	Transcription	easy	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 2	Explain why people might legitimately disagree about how many sounds this particular word contains.\\~\\<how>~\\ 				
84480	Phonological Features	hard	Quiz 3, Question 12	Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/dutch.png} \end{figure}~\\	dutch.png			
84480	Skewed Distributions	medium	Week 5 Handout, Question 5	How would you look for co-occurrence restrictions between [s] and the vowels that come after it in this dataset?\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
84480	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	very hard	Week 6 Handout, Question 11	What do the two signs below tell you about the phonological status of \underline{handshape} in ASL, and why?\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/asl_apple.png} \caption{APPLE} \end{figure} \begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/asl_candy.png} \caption{CANDY} \end{figure}~\\	asl_apple.png	APPLE	asl_candy.png	CANDY
85868	Skewed Distributions	medium	Week 5 Handout, Question 3	What evidence is there that there is a pattern in these data, assuming that these are the only CV and VC sequences that occur in some language?\\~\\{[sa]}, {[ʃi]}, {[za]}, {[ʒi]}, {[as]}, {[iʃ]}, {[az]}, {[iʒ]}~\\ 				
85868	Transcription	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 11	How would this word be transcribed?\\ Kathleen will likely ask a follow-up question about why you used a particular symbol.\\~\\<little>~\\ 				
85868	Phonological Features	easy	Quiz 3, Question 6	Explain why this is an incorrect statement.\\~\\Nasal consonants are {[+continuant]}, because you can continue to make the sound for a long period of time (until you run out of breath).~\\ 				
85868	Articulatory Phonetics	easy	Week 3 Handout, Question 7	Is the symbol given a reasonable way to transcribe any of the sounds described below? If so, which one? If not, why not?\\~\\{[n]}~\\\begin{itemize} \item voiceless palatal affricate \item voiced velar nasal \item voiceless glottal fricative \item voiced labiodental fricative \item voiced interdental fricative \item voiced palatal fricative \end{itemize}~\\
