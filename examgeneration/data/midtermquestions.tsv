Skewed Distributions	medium	Day 5 Handout, Question 6		What would be a good description of the pattern in Malto? What characteristics make that a good description?			malto.png					in published sample exam LING200MT_sampleexam1.pdf	omit	It is not possible to have stops of different places of articulation co-occurring in a single word. Instead, if there are two stops, both must be dental, or both must be retroflex. For example, it’s possible to have a word with two dental stops, as in [tot] ‘to hurry’ (even if they disagree in voicing, as in [tind] ‘to feed’), or a word with two retroflex stops, as in [ɖebɖe] ‘crooked’ (again, regardless of voicing, as in [ɖeʈa] ‘corn cob’). But there are no words that have one dental and one retroflex stop, in either order, regardless of voicing. (accurate, generalizations, concrete examples)

The sounds [pʰ] and [f] are in complementary distribution.

The sounds [l] and [ɾ] are in overlapping distribution, but just occur as pronunciation variants of the same morpheme, as in [mul] ‘water’ and [muɾe] ‘at the water.’ Thus, we know that these sounds are in free variation.		korean.png							no; the sounds are allophonic, because the words are not actually identical -- these have different phonological contexts

Phonological Relationships and Analysis	easy	Quiz 5, Question 10		Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.	We should posit /r/ as the underlying form, and have a rule that devoices it when it occurs after voiceless segments. This analysis is best because it requires only one rule with a single environment to account for all the occurrences of both [r] and [r̥]; the plain [r] sounds result from non-application of the rule.		peng71_englishr.png							a good analysis
Phonological Relationships and Analysis	easy	Quiz 5, Question 10		Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.	We should posit /r̥/ as the underlying form, and have a rule that voices it when it occurs after voiced segments or word-initially. This analysis is best because it puts the more unusual sound, the voiceless [r̥], into the underlying representation, which has to be memorized anyway.		peng71_englishr.png							not a good analysis, because we want the UR to occur in the MOST environments, not the FEWEST (makes the rule simpler)

Phonological Relationships and Analysis	very hard	Day 7 Handout, Question 9		What is the basic analysis of vowel length in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?			malayalam.png							Short and long vowels appear to be contrastive (phonemic) in Malayalam, as evidenced by minimal pairs that differ only in terms of their vowel length, such as [koʈːa] ‘basket’ vs. [koːʈːa] ‘castle’ or [keʈːu] ‘burnt out’ vs. [keːʈːu] ‘heard.’
Phonological Relationships and Analysis	very hard	Day 7 Handout, Question 11		What is the basic analysis of voiceless stops in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?			english11.png							Plain and aspirated voiceless stops are in complementary distribution in English. Plain stops occur always and only after [s], as in [speɪs] ‘space,’ while aspirated stops never occur in this context. Meanwhile, aspirated stops occur word-initially (e.g., [phitʃ] ‘peach’) and between vowels (e.g., [əphɑɹt] ‘apart’). Because the two are in complementary distribution, we can always predict which one occurs in any given environment, and so we conclude that they are allophonic, i.e., allophones of the same phoneme category. 
Phonological Relationships and Analysis	very hard	Day 7 Handout, Question 12		What is the basic analysis of oral and nasal vowels in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?			english12.png							The pairs of sounds [i] and [ĩ], and [u] and [ũ], are each allophonic and therefore allophones of the same phoneme in English (though the two pairs represent two contrastive phonemes in English). The sounds [i] and [ĩ] are in complementary distribution in English, with [ĩ] occurring before the sounds [m] and [n], (e.g., [ɡlĩm] ‘gleam’ and [klĩn] ‘clean’) and [i] occurring elsewhere (e.g., [lip] ‘leap’). Similarly, the sounds [u] and [ũ] are also in complementary distribution, with exactly the same conditioning environments: [ũ] occurs before [m] and [n] (e.g., [dũm] ‘doom’ and [dũn] ‘dune’), and [u] occurs elsewhere (e.g. [but] ‘boot’). Thus, within each pair, we treat the vowels as allophonic.
