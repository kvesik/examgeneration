Plain stops occur always and only after [s], as in [speɪs] ‘space,’ while aspirated stops never occur in this context. Meanwhile, aspirated stops occur word-initially (e.g., [phitʃ] ‘peach’) and between vowels (e.g., [əphɑɹt] ‘apart’). Because the two are in complementary distribution, we can always predict which one occurs in any given environment, and so we conclude that they are allophonic, i.e., allophones of the same phoneme category. [Note that they should also talk about the relaionship between two aspirated or two plain stops, i.e., that they're contrastive.]

The sounds [i] and [ĩ] are in complementary distribution in English, with [ĩ] occurring before the sounds [m] and [n], (e.g., [ɡlĩm] ‘gleam’ and [klĩn] ‘clean’) and [i] occurring elsewhere (e.g., [lip] ‘leap’). Similarly, the sounds [u] and [ũ] are also in complementary distribution, with exactly the same conditioning environments: [ũ] occurs before [m] and [n] (e.g., [dũm] ‘doom’ and [dũn] ‘dune’), and [u] occurs elsewhere (e.g. [but] ‘boot’). Thus, within each pair, we treat the vowels as allophonic. 
QU1602621944466	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	hard	n/a	Week 6 Handout, Question 1	Day 6 Handout, Question 1	2021-06-01		Explain why it is possible to predict whether a plain or aspirated voiceless stop will occur in a new context (in English), but not to predict the place of articulation of a voiceless stop in a new context.			aspiration.png							There is a pattern to the distribution of plain vs. aspirated stops. Plain stops occur only after [s], while aspirated stops occur only word-initially. So, if I have a new context, I look to see whether the 'blank' is after [s] or after [\#] and predict accordingly. For place of articulation, though, we can't predict, because bilabial, alveolar, and velar stops all occur in identical environments -- so nothing in the environment can help us predict which sound will occur, and so in a new environment, we still don't know.

Explain why or why not.			aspiration.png							We would not expect glottal stop to follow the same pattern. Although all are voiceless stops, these are phonetic characteristics, not phonological features. While [p, t, k] are all [-voice, -continuant], glottal stop is [0cont] so it doesn't fall into the same natural class and wouldn't be expected to follow the same pattern.

What characteristics make that a good description?			malto.png							It is not possible to have stops of different places of articulation co-occurring in a single word. Instead, if there are two stops, both must be dental, or both must be retroflex. For example, it’s possible to have a word with two dental stops, as in [tot] ‘to hurry’ (even if they disagree in voicing, as in [tind] ‘to feed’), or a word with two retroflex stops, as in [ɖebɖe] ‘crooked’ (again, regardless of voicing, as in [ɖeʈa] ‘corn cob’). But there are no words that have one dental and one retroflex stop, in either order, regardless of voicing. (accurate, generalizations, concrete examples)

[s] and [Sj] on the other hand have 'opposite' patterns, so you can always predict which will occur based on the vowel.

Explain why or why not.			malto.png							Yes, it's possible; in Malto, if there are two stops in a word, they must either both be dental or both retroflex. Since the first sound is dental, the second must also be dental (though to be fair, you couldn't actually predict that it's [d] and not [t], but the question restricts it to only the voiced options).

Explain why or why not.			malto.png							No, it's not possible. In Malto, you can predict that there are two dental or two retroflex stops in a word, but you can't predict the voicing. These two sounds are both dental, so there's no way to predict.

QU1601510836246	Acoustics	hard	Day 8 Discussion	Week 9 Discussion	Day 8 Discussion	2021-06-25	general	Briefly explain source-filter theory.										The vocal folds vibrate, setting the air coming from the lungs into motion -- this is the "source" sound wave, which is a complex wave, with energy at multiple different frequencies – the fundamental and its harmonics, i.e., its multiples. Then the oral and nasal cavities act as a "filter" to dampen (remove energy from) some of the frequencies of the sound and enhance others (the resonant frequencies). Depending on the shape of the mouth, different frequencies will resonate and so we get different formant values and hence different vowel qualities.

This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant.

In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs are the source of most speech sounds. $^{14}$\ul{The basic rate of vibration is called the fundamental frequency}; $^{15}$\ul{the fundamental frequency is also known as the timbre of the voice.} In addition to the source, we can also talk about a filter: $^{16}$\ul{the vocal folds act as a filter to shape the air from the lungs into the sounds we hear as different.} $^{17}$\ul{The mouth and nose act as resonance chambers}, and these also affect the qualities of the sounds.									14 - true.\\15 - false (the fundamental frequency is also known as the pitch of the voice, or F0).\\16 - false (the mouth and nose act as a filter to shape the air from the vocal folds in the sounds we hear as different, or vocal tract, or articulatory and resonance chambers, etc).\\17 - true.

Different: the harmonics are differently spaced, so the fundamental frequency is different, and hence the pitches will be different. In particular, the top one has a LOWER pitch than the bottom one -- its harmonics are closer together, so the fundamental was a lower number to start with.

QU1601511515501	Dataset	very hard	Final Exam Dataset	Final Exam Dataset	Final Exam Dataset	2021-06-25		Explain how you would go about figuring out what to analyse in this dataset.			final_dataset.png							The first thing to do is a morphological analysis. There should be morphemes that represent each of the four tenses / aspects (present, past, future, and progressive), and morphemes that represent each root. The morphemes representing the tenses appear as (relatively) consistent forms in the columns; the morphemes representing the roots appear as consistent forms in the rows. Doing this reveals that the final 3 segments in the present forms and the final two segments in the progressive forms are suffixes (there are no zero morphemes, and all components have a one-to-one correspondence). Then we check for alternations. The alternations here are in the suffixes; each of the four suffixes has two forms. There are therefore four alternations, with two allomorphs each. So, what we need to analyze are the alternations in the suffix forms, where we see vowels alternating. Two of the alternations involve [i] and [ɯ], and the other two alternations involve [e] and [ɤ]. In each case, there’s a front vowel and a back vowel, which are otherwise matched for height and rounding, so we can likely generalize across the alternations.

The allomorph with the back vowel occurs after another back vowel of the same height (e.g., [fɯd] in [jɤɡɯd-fɯd] ‘swallow, present’ or [sɤ] in [mikɤv-sɤ] ‘search, progressive’), regardless of any intervening consonants. The allomorph with the front vowel occurs elsewhere, including after a front vowel (e.g. [fid] in [sat-fid] ‘chew, present’ or [se] in [sat-se] ‘chew, progressive’) and after a back vowel of a different height (e.g. [fid] in [mikɤv-fid] ‘search, present’ or [se] in [jɤɡɯd-se] ‘swallow, progressive’). Again, these latter environments are regardless of any intervening consonants.

For the morphemes that alternate, the back-vowel version occurs in the narrower set of contexts (after a back vowel of the same height), so should be the one that we write a rule for. The front-vowel version occurs in the wider / elsewhere set of contexts (after a front vowel and after a back vowel of a different height), so this should be the UR.

This rule says that a vowel will become back if it follows another back vowel of the same height, regardless of any intervening consonants. We know this is the rule we need because we need to account for the suffix alternations; the suffixes appear either with a front vowel or a back vowel. The back versions occur only after a back vowel of the same height (so are the focus of the rule); the front vowels occur elsewhere (after a front vowel, or after a back vowel of a different height). We could have two separate rules, one for mid vowels and one for high vowels, but this misses the generalization that these rules are basically doing the same thing.
QU1601510566635	Dataset	very hard	Final Exam Dataset	Final Exam Dataset	Final Exam Dataset	2021-06-25	analysis	Explain what the basic phonological analysis of this dataset is, and what the key pieces of evidence are.			final_dataset.png							The basic analysis here is that vowels of the same height need to agree in terms of backness. We see this in suffix alternations: there are four alternating suffixes, each with a back and front variant, and two of them have high vowels while two of them have mid vowels. Whenever the suffix comes after a root containing a back vowel at the same height as the suffix, the suffix also contains a back vowel, but when the root contains either a front vowel or a back vowel at a different height, the suffix contains the front vowel. Thus, we posit the front versions as the URs of the suffixes, because they occur in the wider set of contexts, and write a rule of vowel backing that only applies when the target vowel follows a back context vowel of the same height.

Vowel laxing: /i/ → [ɪ] / \{[ɛ], [ɔ]\} C$_0$\_\_									no; it's a single sound, so replacing it with features just makes it hard to read

Vowel laxing: /i/ → [ɪ] / \{[ɛ], [ɔ]\} C$_0$\_\_									yes; although it's a single sound, the sound is different from the input in exactly one way (it's lax instead of tense), so we want to capture that specific change (and only have to list one feature); it also helps us to see the naturalness of the rule, as the feature that is changing is related to the features that occur in the context

QU1601511413134	Syllables	easy	Day 11 Discussion	Week 11 Discussion	Day 11 Discussion	2021-06-25	general	Explain why the sonority sequencing principle would block the syllabification of [n] and [t] of [n.ta] into one syllable in Ponapean.										[n] is higher sonority than [t], and the SSP requires that segments increase in sonority as you get closer to the nucleus and decrease in sonority as you move away; [nte] would involve a dip and then a rise in sonority

In both, you have rules and the assumption that these rules will get you predictable syllable structure. In the rule-based approach, you ONLY have rules, so you don't know ahead of time what possible syllable types you might get; you also need to know which rules apply in a language and what the order of the rules is -- but in the templatic approach, you have a template that tells you ahead of time what the possible syllable types are, and you use the template in conjunction with rules. In the templatic approach, you also need to know the direction of syllabification (L to R or R to L), not the order of the rules. [Note: should not mention anything about the units used in either approach)

But if you have /C/ as the underlying form, it’s clear that we occasionally need an extra vowel in order to allow syllabification to happen; otherwise, we’d end up with non-syllabifiable CCC sequences. That is, there’s a phonological motivation for the insertion rule, but no motivation for the deletion rule.

Then last-TBU linking applies and links the leftover L tone to the last TBU ([e]). Last-tone linking will not apply because there are no leftover TBUs.

We see that these are the five basic patterns of tone, and they can get stretched out or squished together, but there are all five, so we assume that these are the tonal invntory. For any actual word, we take its segments and combine it (without associaton lines) with the appropriate tonal category.

In this case, we (1) look at cases of words that have one of the contour tones, because words with only H or only L will just always have a single tone associated with all of the TBUs, but contour tones can help you see e.g. “where” the contour happens; (2) look at cases of words with a mismatch in the number of tones and TBUs (e.g. HL tones and VVV, or LHL tones and VV), because these are cases where one-to-one mapping will fail. By seeing that the “tail” of contours is to the left, not the right (e.g., it’s LLH not LHH) and that in the triple-tone words with two TBUs, we have the contour to the left (LH, then L; not L, then HL), we see that the “leftover” stuff needs to be on the left edge instead of the right edge. Hence, the initial mapping procedure should proceed from right to left instead of left to right.

For example, the causative suffix appears with a H tone, as [és], in [-téŋɡ-és-á] ‘sell,’ but with a L tone, as [ès], in [-èrèŋɡ-ès-à] ‘make read.’
