43803	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Week 3 Handout, Question 3	Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\~\\Original set: {[u]}, {[ʊ]}, {[oʊ]}, {[ɔ]}~\\Addition: {[ɔɪ]}~\\ 				
43803	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 3	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tetra-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tetra-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i...u...u]} \item {[a...a...i...i]} \item {[u...u...u...u]} \item {[i...i...i...a]} \end{itemize}~\\ 				
18870	Skewed Distributions	medium	Week 5 Handout, Question 3	What evidence is there that there is a pattern in these data, assuming that these are the only CV and VC sequences that occur in some language?\\~\\{[sa]}, {[ʃi]}, {[za]}, {[ʒi]}, {[as]}, {[iʃ]}, {[az]}, {[iʒ]}~\\ 				
18870	Phonological Features	hard	Quiz 3, Question 12	Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/dutch.png} \end{figure}~\\	dutch.png			
28926	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[v]}, {[z]}, {[ʃ]}, {[ʒ]}, {[ð]}~\\ 				
28926	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Homework 1, Question 3(a)	Could this image be the result of producing the sound represented by the given IPA symbol? Why or why not?\\~\\{[ɾ]}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/staticpalatography_stop.png} \end{figure}~\\	staticpalatography_stop.png			
83324	Transcription	hard	Week 2 Handout, Part II	Is this a reasonable transcription of this word? Explain why.\\~\\<wimp>: {[wimp]}~\\ 				
83324	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Week 3 Handout, Question 9	Explain how to figure out what the sound being produced is in this diagram.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/sagittal_t.png} \end{figure}~\\	sagittal_t.png			
80815	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[e]}, {[ɛ]}, {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}, {[ɔ]}, {[o]}, {[ʊ]}, {[u]}, {[ʒ]}, {[k]}, {[ɡ]}, {[ŋ]}, {[w]}~\\ 				
80815	Transcription	hard	Week 2 Handout, Part II	Is this a reasonable transcription of this word? Explain why.\\~\\<health>: {[hɛlð]}~\\
