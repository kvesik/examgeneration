11661	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ɛ]}, {[u]}, {[ʊ]}~\\ 				
79667	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Week 3 Handout, Question 13	Explain why this image does or does not match the description.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item A one-handed sign. \item Location: At the signer’s nose. \item Handshape: Starts with index finger extended; finger folds down into a “hook” shape during the sign; then straightens and repeats the folding. \item Movement: No movement other than the change in handshape. \end{itemize}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/taiwansign_wrong.png} \caption{WRONG} \end{figure}~\\	taiwansign_wrong.png	WRONG

52900	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Quiz 2, Question 6	In the pronunciation of this word, which sounds are obstruents and which are sonorants? Explain your answer.\\~\\<obstruent>~\\ 				
67535	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 7	Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as a compression wave.... $^6$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, they try to spread out as far as possible, and that’s why they move out as a wave.}\\\\There are several key components of a sound wave. The first is wavelength. $^7$\ul{Wavelength is the distance between the point of maximum rarefaction and the point of maximum compression in a wave.} Another component that is related to wavelength is $^8$\ul{frequency, or how many times a wave passes through a particular point in one second.} $^9$\ul{If the wavelength is really short, the frequency will be really high; if the wavelength is really long, the frequency will be really low.} ~\\

30794	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 4	Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\~\\This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.~\\
