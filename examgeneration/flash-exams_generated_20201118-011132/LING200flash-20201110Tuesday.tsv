29164	Transcription	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 11	How would this word be transcribed?\\ (Kathleen will then ask a follow-up question about your transcription.)\\~\\<nice>~\\ 				
29164	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 6	If I gave you a new word in Malto, [di\_\_u], would it be possible to predict whether it's [d] or [ɖ] that goes in the blank? Explain why or why not.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/malto.png} \end{figure}~\\	malto.png			
17357	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Homework 1, Question 3(a)	Could this image be the result of producing the sound represented by the given IPA symbol? Why or why not?\\~\\{[n]}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/staticpalatography_stop.png} \end{figure}~\\	staticpalatography_stop.png			
17357	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[e]}, {[ɛ]}, {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}, {[ɔ]}, {[o]}, {[ʊ]}, {[u]}, {[ʒ]}, {[k]}, {[ɡ]}, {[ŋ]}, {[w]}~\\ 				
45517	Transcription	hard	Week 2 Handout, Part II	Is this a reasonable transcription of this word? Explain why.\\~\\<paid>: {[peid]}~\\ 				
45517	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\ 				
37843	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Week 3 Handout, Question 3	Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\~\\Original set: {[ɛ]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ʊ]}, {[ɔ]}~\\Addition: {[ɑ]}~\\ 				
37843	Other (pre-midterm)	medium	Week 4 Handout, Part II, Question 2(iv)	Explain how you would figure out the Swahili word for this English gloss. (To be clear: you do NOT need to give me the Swahili form itself -- just explain the process of figuring it out.)\\~\\‘She will beat us.’~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/swahiliverbs.png} \end{figure}~\\	swahiliverbs.png			
17359	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Week 3 Handout, Question 3	Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\~\\Original set: {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}~\\Addition: {[ɑɪ]}~\\
