The sounds {[pʰ]} and {[p̚]} are in complementary distribution. {[pʰ]} occurs after front vowels, as in {[kæpʰ]} ‘cap,’ while {[p̚]} occurs after back vowels, as in {[tʃɑp̚]} ‘chop.’

\begin{figure}[H]

The sounds {[l]} and {[ɾ]} are in overlapping distribution. They can both occur after {[u]}, as in {[mul]} ‘water’ and {[muɾe]} ‘at the water.’ Thus, we know that these sounds are contrastive.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\large Question 20} - Source: Day 6 Handout, Question 6\\

Is the statement given below a good description of the distribution of sounds in this dataset? Why or why not?\\

The sounds {[l]} and {[ɾ]} are in overlapping distribution, but just occur as pronunciation variants of the same morpheme, as in {[mul]} ‘water’ and {[muɾe]} ‘at the water.’ Thus, we know that these sounds are in free variation.

\begin{figure}[H]

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: We would probably pick the alveolar version /s/ to be the underlying representation, because it occurs in a wider set of contexts. That way, we can write a single rule to derive the more limited distribution of the palatal, and not need rules to explain any of alveolar occurrences.

Explain how you would choose the underlying representation for the phoneme with allophones [ʊ] and [ɯ].\\

\begin{figure}[H]

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The phoneme category should be /ʊ/, because it occurs in the wider range of situations – especially when there is no preceding vowel that would condition whether it should be rounded or not. That is, it seems to the be “default” vowel.

What is the basic analysis of vowel length in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/malayalam.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Short and long vowels appear to be contrastive (phonemic) in Malayalam, as evidenced by minimal pairs that differ only in terms of their vowel length, such as [koʈːa] ‘basket’ vs. [koːʈːa] ‘castle’ or [keʈːu] ‘burnt out’ vs. [keːʈːu] ‘heard.’

{\large Question 5} - Source: Day 7 Handout, Question 11\\

What is the basic analysis of voiceless stops in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/english11.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Plain and aspirated voiceless stops are in complementary distribution in English. Plain stops occur always and only after [s], as in [speɪs] ‘space,’ while aspirated stops never occur in this context. Meanwhile, aspirated stops occur word-initially (e.g., [phitʃ] ‘peach’) and between vowels (e.g., [əphɑɹt] ‘apart’). Because the two are in complementary distribution, we can always predict which one occurs in any given environment, and so we conclude that they are allophonic, i.e., allophones of the same phoneme category. 


~\\

{\large Question 6} - Source: Day 7 Handout, Question 12\\

What is the basic analysis of oral and nasal vowels in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/english12.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The pairs of sounds [i] and [ĩ], and [u] and [ũ], are each allophonic and therefore allophones of the same phoneme in English (though the two pairs represent two contrastive phonemes in English). The sounds [i] and [ĩ] are in complementary distribution in English, with [ĩ] occurring before the sounds [m] and [n], (e.g., [ɡlĩm] ‘gleam’ and [klĩn] ‘clean’) and [i] occurring elsewhere (e.g., [lip] ‘leap’). Similarly, the sounds [u] and [ũ] are also in complementary distribution, with exactly the same conditioning environments: [ũ] occurs before [m] and [n] (e.g., [dũm] ‘doom’ and [dũn] ‘dune’), and [u] occurs elsewhere (e.g. [but] ‘boot’). Thus, within each pair, we treat the vowels as allophonic.

{\large Question 1} - Source: Quiz 5, Question 10\\

Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.\\

Because {[r]} and {[r̥]} are contrastive in English, we cannot write a rule to account for their distribution.

~\\

{\large Question 2} - Source: Quiz 5, Question 10\\

Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.\\

We should posit /r/ as the underlying form, and have a rule that devoices it when it occurs after voiceless segments. This analysis is best because it requires only one rule with a single environment to account for all the occurrences of both {[r]} and {[r̥]}; the plain {[r]} sounds result from non-application of the rule.

{\large Question 3} - Source: Quiz 5, Question 10\\

Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.\\

We should posit /r̥/ as the underlying form, and have a rule that voices it when it occurs after voiced segments or word-initially. This analysis is best because it puts the more unusual sound, the voiceless {[r̥]}, into the underlying representation, which has to be memorized anyway.

\begin{figure}[H]

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: not a good analysis, because we want the UR to occur in the MOST environments, not the FEWEST (makes the rule simpler)

{\large Question 4} - Source: Quiz 5, Question 10\\

Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.\\
