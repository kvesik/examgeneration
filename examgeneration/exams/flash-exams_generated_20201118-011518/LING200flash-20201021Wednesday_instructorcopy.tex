{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Week 4 Discussion\\

Explain what the given feature’s value is for this class of sounds, and why.\\

{[approximant]}

nasals


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [-], because air can't escape through the mouth ([+approx] sounds have a narrowing in the vocal tract, but air escapes without friction)

{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Phonological Relationships and Analysis\\
Source: Week 6 Handout, Question 1\\

Would you expect [ʔ] to follow the same pattern of occurring as plain or aspirated as is followed by [p] and [t] and [k]? Explain why or why not.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: We would not expect glottal stop to follow the same pattern. Although all are voiceless stops, these are phonetic characteristics, not phonological features. While [p, t, k] are all [-voice, -continuant], glottal stop is [0cont] so it doesn't fall into the same natural class and wouldn't be expected to follow the same pattern.

Why should the following two questions have the same answer?\\

\begin{itemize} \item Given the vowel system of Jita, how many bi-syllabic root types would you expect to find for nouns in the language? \item Assuming that the vowel inventory is the same in verbs as it is in nouns, how many bisyllabic root types would you expect to find for verbs in the language? \end{itemize}

{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Skewed Distributions\\
Source: Week 5 Handout, Question 6\\

If I gave you a new word in Malto, [di\_\_u], would it be possible to predict whether it's [d] or [ɖ] that goes in the blank? Explain why or why not.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/malto.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Yes, it's possible; in Malto, if there are two stops in a word, they must either both be dental or both retroflex. Since the first sound is dental, the second must also be dental (though to be fair, you couldn't actually predict that it's [d] and not [t], but the question restricts it to only the voiced options).

Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}

Addition: {[ɑɪ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class
