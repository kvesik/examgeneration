45248	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\ 				
45248	Other (pre-midterm)	hard	Week 5 \& 6 Handouts	Explain how you could analyze this dataset in terms of sequential patterns vs. paradigmatic patterns.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
99531	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 5	Explain why looking for patterns with consonants and vowels is a more reasonable approach to pattern finding in this dataset than looking for patterns with respect to all of the individual sounds in Ukrainian.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
99531	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[e]}, {[ɛ]}, {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}, {[ɔ]}, {[o]}, {[ʊ]}, {[u]}, {[ʒ]}, {[k]}, {[ɡ]}, {[ŋ]}, {[w]}~\\ 				
51191	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Homework 1, Question 3(a)	Could this image be the result of producing the sound represented by the given IPA symbol? Why or why not?\\~\\{[t͡ʃ]}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/staticpalatography_fricative.png} \end{figure}~\\	staticpalatography_fricative.png			
51191	Other (pre-midterm)	medium	Week 4 Handout, Part II, Question 3	Explain how you would figure out what the Luiseño form is for the morpheme whose meaning is given below. (To be clear: you do NOT need to give me the form itself -- just explain the process of figuring it out.)\\~\\‘Future’~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/luiseno.png} \end{figure}~\\	luiseno.png			
11925	Other (pre-midterm)	hard	Week 5 \& 6 Handouts	Explain how you could analyze this dataset in terms of sequential patterns vs. paradigmatic patterns.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
11925	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Homework 1, Question 3(b)	Explain why this is or is not a complete phonetic natural class in standard North American English.\\~\\{[i]}, {[u]}, {[eɪ]}~\\ 				
43736	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Homework 1, Question 3(b)	Explain why this is or is not a complete phonetic natural class in standard North American English.\\~\\{[j]}, {[w]}~\\ 				
43736	Other (pre-midterm)	hard	Week 5 \& 6 Handouts	Explain how you could analyze this dataset in terms of sequential patterns vs. paradigmatic patterns.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
74115	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 4	Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\~\\This consonant typically starts off with nothing at all visible on the spectrogram. There is then a short period of noise between the silence and the following vowel. This consonant typically brings the second and third formants of the adjacent vowel down.~\\ 				
74115	Phonological Features	hard	Quiz 3, Question 12	Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/dutch.png} \end{figure}~\\	dutch.png
