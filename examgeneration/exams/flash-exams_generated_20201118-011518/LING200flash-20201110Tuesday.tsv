29164	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\

37843	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 4	Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\~\\This consonant is characterized by having a lot of random noise in the spectrogram, with no clear formant structure at all. It tends to be longer and louder than other similar consonants. There is no voice bar, and the majority of the noise created by this consonant is at relatively high frequencies.~\\
