Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[u]}, {[ʊ]}, {[oʊ]}, {[ɔ]}

Addition: {[ɑʊ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class
