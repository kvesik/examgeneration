Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

Explain how you would figure out the Swahili word for this English gloss. (To be clear: you do NOT need to give me the Swahili form itself -- just explain the process of figuring it out.)\\

Explain how you would go about looking for co-occurrence restrictions in bi-syllabic signs in ASL.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You would start by coming up with all the possible combinations expected (i.e., 4x4 = 16). Then you'd compare that to some database of signs in ASL and see which combinations are actually attested or unattested.

Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tri-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tri-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\

\begin{itemize} \item {[u...i...a]} \item {[a...i...a]} \item {[u...u...a]} \item {[a...i...i]} \end{itemize}
