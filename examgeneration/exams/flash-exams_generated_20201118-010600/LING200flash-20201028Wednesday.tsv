36116	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 6	If I gave you a new word in Malto, [di\_\_u], would it be possible to predict whether it's [d] or [t] that goes in the blank? Explain why or why not.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/malto.png} \end{figure}~\\	malto.png

17335	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Quiz 2, Question 7	Why might more than one of the descriptions given truthfully apply to the sound represented by the underlined letter, and why is one of them actually better than the other?\\~\\<a\underline{w}ay>~\\\begin{itemize} \item prevocalic obstruent \item prevocalic sonorant \item postvocalic obstruent \item postvocalic sonorant \item intervocalic obstruent \item intervocalic sonorant \end{itemize}~\\

33446	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 2	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tri-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tri-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[u...i...a]} \item {[a...i...a]} \item {[u...u...a]} \item {[a...i...i]} \end{itemize}~\\

27762	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 3	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tetra-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tetra-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i...u...u]} \item {[a...a...i...i]} \item {[u...u...u...u]} \item {[i...i...i...a]} \end{itemize}~\\

19711	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[e]}, {[ɛ]}, {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}, {[ɔ]}, {[o]}, {[ʊ]}, {[u]}, {[ʒ]}, {[k]}, {[ɡ]}, {[ŋ]}, {[w]}~\\
