45248	Other (pre-midterm)	hard	Week 5 \& 6 Handouts	Explain how you could analyze this dataset in terms of sequential patterns vs. paradigmatic patterns.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
45248	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[b]}, {[d]}, {[z]}, {[ɾ]}, {[n]}, {[l]}, {[ɹ]}~\\ 				
99531	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 7	Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs are the source of most speech sounds. $^{14}$\ul{The basic rate of vibration is called the fundamental frequency}; $^{15}$\ul{the fundamental frequency is also known as the timbre of the voice.} In addition to the source, we can also talk about a filter: $^{16}$\ul{the vocal folds act as a filter to shape the air from the lungs into the sounds we hear as different.} $^{17}$\ul{The mouth and nose act as resonance chambers}, and these also affect the qualities of the sounds.~\\ 				
99531	Transcription	hard	Week 2 Handout, Part II	Is this a reasonable transcription of this word? Explain why.\\~\\<wimp>: {[wimp]}~\\ 				
51191	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Homework 1, Question 3(b)	Explain why this is or is not a complete phonetic natural class in standard North American English.\\~\\{[f]}, {[θ]}, {[z]}, {[h]}~\\ 				
51191	Other (pre-midterm)	hard	Week 5 \& 6 Handouts	Explain how you could analyze this dataset in terms of sequential patterns vs. paradigmatic patterns.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
11925	Transcription	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 11	How would this word be transcribed?\\ (Kathleen will then ask a follow-up question about your transcription.)\\~\\<finger>~\\ 				
11925	Acoustics	hard	Quiz 7, Question 2	Explain what you see in the spectrogram that tells you about the properties of the sounds in the pictured word.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/spectrogram_hippo.png} \end{figure}~\\	spectrogram_hippo.png			
43736	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Week 3 Handout, Question 3	Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\~\\Original set: {[u]}, {[ʊ]}, {[oʊ]}, {[ɔ]}~\\Addition: {[ɔɪ]}~\\ 				
43736	Transcription	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 11	How would this word be transcribed?\\ (Kathleen will then ask a follow-up question about your transcription.)\\~\\<finger>~\\ 				
74115	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 7	Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\$^{10}$\ul{Frequency is inversely related to pitch: high frequencies correspond to low pitches, and low frequencies correspond to high pitches.} Finally, there is the amplitude of the wave. $^{11}$\ul{The amplitude tells you how much pressure the molecules are under at any particular time.} $^{12}$\ul{The auditory correlate of amplitude is intensity}; this is a measure of perceived pressure.\\\\$^{13}$\ul{In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs} are the source of most speech sounds.~\\
