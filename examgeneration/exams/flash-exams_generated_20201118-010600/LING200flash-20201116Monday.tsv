11661	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 5	Explain why looking for patterns with consonants and vowels is a more reasonable approach to pattern finding in this dataset than looking for patterns with respect to all of the individual sounds in Ukrainian.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
11661	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ɛ]}, {[u]}, {[ʊ]}~\\ 				
79667	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Week 3 Handout, Question 13	Explain why this image does or does not match the description.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item A one-handed sign. \item Location: At the signer’s nose. \item Handshape: Starts with index finger extended; finger folds down into a “hook” shape during the sign; then straightens and repeats the folding. \item Movement: No movement other than the change in handshape. \end{itemize}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/taiwansign_wrong.png} \caption{WRONG} \end{figure}~\\	taiwansign_wrong.png	WRONG		
79667	Transcription	hard	Week 2 Handout, Part II	Is this a reasonable transcription of this word? Explain why.\\~\\<climb>: {[klɑɪm]}~\\ 				
52900	Acoustics	hard	Quiz 7, Question 2	Explain what you see in the spectrogram that tells you about the properties of the sounds in the pictured word.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/spectrogram_hippo.png} \end{figure}~\\	spectrogram_hippo.png			
52900	Transcription	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 11	How would this word be transcribed?\\ (Kathleen will then ask a follow-up question about your transcription.)\\~\\<vacuum>~\\ 				
67535	Acoustics	hard	Week 9 Handout, Question 6	Explain what you see in the spectrogram that tells you about the properties of the sounds in the pictured word.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/spectrogram_suit.png} \end{figure}~\\	spectrogram_suit.png			
67535	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Week 3 Discussion	Assuming a Standard North American English inventory, does this vowel need to have tenseness specified if you're giving a prose description? Why or why not?\\~\\{[ɑ]}~\\ 				
30794	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 5	Explain why looking for patterns with consonants and vowels is a more reasonable approach to pattern finding in this dataset than looking for patterns with respect to all of the individual sounds in Ukrainian.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
30794	Other (pre-midterm)	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part I, Question 1	Is this question about phonetics or phonology, and why? (To be clear: you do NOT need to answer the question itself -- just tell me whether it's a question about phonetics or phonology.)\\~\\What do you think the difference is between vowels and consonants?~\\
