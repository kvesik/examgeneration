INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Other (pre-midterm)\\
Source: Week 2 Handout, Part I, Question 8\\

Is this question about phonetics or phonology, and why? (To be clear: you do NOT need to answer the question itself -- just tell me whether it's a question about phonetics or phonology.)\\

Consider the following two words from American Sign Language. The first one means LUCKY, while the second means SMART. How would you describe the difference between the ``pronunciation'' (articulation) of these two words? Note that in each case, the image to the left is the starting position of the sign, while the one to the right is the ending position.

Topic: Articulatory Phonetics\\

Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}

Addition: {[ɑʊ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class
