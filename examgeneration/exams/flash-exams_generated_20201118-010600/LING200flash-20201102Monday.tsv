78680	Other (pre-midterm)	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part I, Question 8	Is this question about phonetics or phonology, and why? (To be clear: you do NOT need to answer the question itself -- just tell me whether it's a question about phonetics or phonology.)\\~\\Consider the following two words from American Sign Language. The first one means LUCKY, while the second means SMART. How would you describe the difference between the ``pronunciation'' (articulation) of these two words? Note that in each case, the image to the left is the starting position of the sign, while the one to the right is the ending position.~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/asl_lucky.png} \end{figure} \begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/asl_smart.png} \end{figure}~\\	asl_lucky.png		asl_smart.png
