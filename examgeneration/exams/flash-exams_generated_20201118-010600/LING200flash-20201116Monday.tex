Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Homework 2, Question 1\\

Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\

{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ɛ]}, {[u]}, {[ʊ]}

Explain why this image does or does not match the description.\\

\begin{itemize} \item A one-handed sign. \item Location: At the signer’s nose. \item Handshape: Starts with index finger extended; finger folds down into a “hook” shape during the sign; then straightens and repeats the folding. \item Movement: No movement other than the change in handshape. \end{itemize}
