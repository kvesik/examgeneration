33428	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 4	Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\~\\This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.~\\
