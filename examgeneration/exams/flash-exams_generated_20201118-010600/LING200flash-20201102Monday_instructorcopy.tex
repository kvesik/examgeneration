{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Other (pre-midterm)\\
Source: Week 2 Handout, Part I, Question 8\\

Is this question about phonetics or phonology, and why? (To be clear: you do NOT need to answer the question itself -- just tell me whether it's a question about phonetics or phonology.)\\

Consider the following two words from American Sign Language. The first one means LUCKY, while the second means SMART. How would you describe the difference between the ``pronunciation'' (articulation) of these two words? Note that in each case, the image to the left is the starting position of the sign, while the one to the right is the ending position.

If I gave you a new word in Malto, [di\_\_u], would it be possible to predict whether it's [d] or [t] that goes in the blank? Explain why or why not.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: No, it's not possible. In Malto, you can predict that there are two dental or two retroflex stops in a word, but you can't predict the voicing. These two sounds are both dental, so there's no way to predict.

Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

Explain what the given feature’s value is for this class of sounds, and why.\\

{[LABIAL]}

interdentals


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: 0, because interdentals aren't [LABIAL], but [LABIAL] is monovalent, so they're not [-labial]

Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[u]}, {[ʊ]}, {[oʊ]}, {[ɔ]}

Addition: {[ɔɪ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class
