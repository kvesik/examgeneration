44746	Other (pre-midterm)	hard	Week 5 \& 6 Handouts	Explain how you could analyze this dataset in terms of sequential patterns vs. paradigmatic patterns.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
44746	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\ 				
74752	Skewed Distributions	medium	Week 5 Handout, Question 3	What evidence is there that there is a pattern in these data, assuming that these are the only CV and VC sequences that occur in some language?\\~\\{[sa]}, {[ʃi]}, {[za]}, {[ʒi]}, {[as]}, {[iʃ]}, {[az]}, {[iʒ]}~\\

94263	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Homework 1, Question 3(a)	Could this image be the result of producing the sound represented by the given IPA symbol? Why or why not?\\~\\{[ɾ]}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/staticpalatography_stop.png} \end{figure}~\\	staticpalatography_stop.png			
94263	Phonological Features	medium	Quiz 3, Question 3	Explain why this featural specification either does or does not match the given sound.\\~\\{[-consonantal]}, {[+sonorant]}~\\{[h]}~\\ 				
70875	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Week 3 Handout, Question 9	Explain how to figure out what the sound being produced is in this diagram.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/sagittal_m.png} \end{figure}~\\	sagittal_m.png

12377	Phonological Features	hard	Week 4 Discussion	Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\~\\ 				
12377	Other (pre-midterm)	medium	Week 4 Handout, Part II, Question 3	Explain how you would figure out what the Luiseño form is for the morpheme whose meaning is given below. (To be clear: you do NOT need to give me the form itself -- just explain the process of figuring it out.)\\~\\‘drink’~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/luiseno.png} \end{figure}~\\	luiseno.png			
36593	Phonological Features	medium	Week 4 Discussion	Explain what the given feature’s value is for this class of sounds, and why.\\~\\{[consonantal]}~\\glides~\\ 				
36593	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 7	Explain how you would go about looking for co-occurrence restrictions in bi-syllabic signs in ASL. (Refer to the data that follows.)\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ASL_movement.png} \end{figure}~\\	ASL_movement.png
