Topic: Skewed Distributions\\
Source: Quiz 4, Question 1\\

L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\

\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}


~\\

What evidence is there that there is a pattern in these data, assuming that these are the only CV and VC sequences that occur in some language?\\

{[sa]}, {[ʃi]}, {[za]}, {[ʒi]}, {[as]}, {[iʃ]}, {[az]}, {[iʒ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: (the palatal sounds occur with the high vowel, while the alveolar sounds occur with the low vowel)

Explain why this featural specification either does or does not match the given sound.\\

{[-consonantal]}, {[+sonorant]}

{[h]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: does not match: [h] is [-cons] but also [-son], because its constriction is in the larynx, not the vocal tract

{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Week 4 Discussion\\

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

Explain how you would go about looking for co-occurrence restrictions in bi-syllabic signs in ASL. (Refer to the data that follows.)\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/ASL_movement.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You would start by coming up with all the possible combinations expected (i.e., 4x4 = 16). Then you'd compare that to some database of signs in ASL and see which combinations are actually attested or unattested.
