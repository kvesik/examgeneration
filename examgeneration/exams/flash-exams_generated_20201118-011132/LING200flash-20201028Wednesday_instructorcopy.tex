Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

Explain why this image does or does not match the description.\\

\begin{itemize} \item A two-handed sign. \item Location: In front of signer’s chin. \item Handshape: Starts with an “L” shape; distal joints of index fingers fold in during the sign. \item Movement: Hands start apart and then move straight toward each other horizontally. \end{itemize}

Topic: Skewed Distributions\\

If I gave you a new word in Malto, [di\_\_u], would it be possible to predict whether it's [d] or [ɖ] that goes in the blank? Explain why or why not.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/malto.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Yes, it's possible; in Malto, if there are two stops in a word, they must either both be dental or both retroflex. Since the first sound is dental, the second must also be dental (though to be fair, you couldn't actually predict that it's [d] and not [t], but the question restricts it to only the voiced options).

Addition: {[ɑ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: new vowel is a low vowel; should recognize that there's more than one decision about low vowels and tenseness; default is to say it doesn't belong in the class because tenseness is irrelevant

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You would start by coming up with all the possible combinations expected (i.e., 4x4 = 16). Then you'd compare that to some database of signs in ASL and see which combinations are actually attested or unattested.

{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Week 4 Discussion\\

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).
