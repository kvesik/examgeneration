Explain what you see in the spectrogram that tells you about the properties of the sounds in the pictured word.\\

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: you: clear formants, but starts with something like a glide because fainter; diphthong or changing values; F1 pretty constantly low (=high V); F2 starts high and goes low (=front to back)

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Homework 2, Question 1\\

Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\

{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ɛ]}, {[u]}, {[ʊ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [ɛ] should be removed, so that we have the natural class of high vowels; this could be minimally represented with [+syll, +high]

Explain why this image does or does not match the description.\\

\begin{itemize} \item A one-handed sign. \item Location: At the signer’s nose. \item Handshape: Starts with index finger extended; finger folds down into a “hook” shape during the sign; then straightens and repeats the folding. \item Movement: No movement other than the change in handshape. \end{itemize}

Source: Week 9 Handout, Question 7\\

Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

Sound is a particular kind of wave known as a compression wave.... $^6$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, they try to spread out as far as possible, and that’s why they move out as a wave.}\\\\There are several key components of a sound wave. The first is wavelength. $^7$\ul{Wavelength is the distance between the point of maximum rarefaction and the point of maximum compression in a wave.} Another component that is related to wavelength is $^8$\ul{frequency, or how many times a wave passes through a particular point in one second.} $^9$\ul{If the wavelength is really short, the frequency will be really high; if the wavelength is really long, the frequency will be really low.} 


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: 6 - false (the molecules always try to stay an equal distance from each other, so they move apart when they are compressed and together when they are rarefied).\\7 - false (wavelength is the distance between two points of maximum compression or rarefaction in a wave).\\8 - true.\\9 - true.

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\

This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [ɡ]; check for voicing, place, and manner

Explain why this featural specification either does or does not match the given sound.\\

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: does not match: [h] is [-cons] but also [-son], because its constriction is in the larynx, not the vocal tract
