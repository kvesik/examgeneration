Topic: Articulatory Phonetics\\
Source: Week 3 Handout, Question 3\\

Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[u]}, {[ʊ]}, {[oʊ]}, {[ɔ]}

Addition: {[ɑʊ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class

{[approximant]}

nasals


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [-], because air can't escape through the mouth ([+approx] sounds have a narrowing in the vocal tract, but air escapes without friction)

If I gave you a new word in Malto, [di\_\_u], would it be possible to predict whether it's [d] or [ɖ] that goes in the blank? Explain why or why not.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/malto.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Yes, it's possible; in Malto, if there are two stops in a word, they must either both be dental or both retroflex. Since the first sound is dental, the second must also be dental (though to be fair, you couldn't actually predict that it's [d] and not [t], but the question restricts it to only the voiced options).

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You would start by coming up with all the possible combinations expected (i.e., 4x4 = 16). Then you'd compare that to some database of signs in ASL and see which combinations are actually attested or unattested.

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Collapsing sounds into "consonants" and "vowels" allows us to have 'sufficient data' in a way that thinking about all the individual combinations of sounds would not.

L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tri-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tri-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\

\begin{itemize} \item {[u...i...a]} \item {[a...i...a]} \item {[u...u...a]} \item {[a...i...i]} \end{itemize}
