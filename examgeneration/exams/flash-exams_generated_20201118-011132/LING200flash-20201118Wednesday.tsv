61058	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 7	Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as a compression wave.... $^6$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, they try to spread out as far as possible, and that’s why they move out as a wave.}\\\\There are several key components of a sound wave. The first is wavelength. $^7$\ul{Wavelength is the distance between the point of maximum rarefaction and the point of maximum compression in a wave.} Another component that is related to wavelength is $^8$\ul{frequency, or how many times a wave passes through a particular point in one second.} $^9$\ul{If the wavelength is really short, the frequency will be really high; if the wavelength is really long, the frequency will be really low.} ~\\

33428	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 7	Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\Sound is an invisible phenomenon. Sound can travel through any substance, $^1$\ul{such as a liquid, solid, or a gas.} $^2$\ul{It involves the transfer of the matter in that substance} from one place to another.\\\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as $^3$\ul{a compression wave}. $^4$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, we say they are ``rarefied'' and when they are really far apart, we say they are ``compressed.''}~\\
