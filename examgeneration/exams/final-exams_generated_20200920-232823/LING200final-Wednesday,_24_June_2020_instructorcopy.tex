INSTRUCTOR NOTES: For any morpheme that doesn’t alternate, its UR should be the same as its SR.  For the morphemes that alternate, the back-vowel version occurs in the narrower set of contexts (after a back vowel of the same height), so should be the one that we write a rule for. The front-vowel version occurs in the wider / elsewhere set of contexts (after a front vowel and after a back vowel of a different height), so this should be the UR. So in this case, we have the non-alternating root morpheme ‘dig’ /rekɯl/ and the alternating suffix morpheme 'future' /er/.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/quebecfrench.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: here, syllabification must precede the rest of the analysis; the tense vowels ([i] and [u]) occur in open syllables, while the lax vowels occur in closed syllables -- so e.g. we might have a rule of vowel laxing that says [+high, +syll] --> [-tense] / \_\_ C., with a period to specifically mark the syllable boundary in the context of the rule

How does syllabification play a role in the analysis of Tibetan numerals?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/tibetan.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: morphemes that seem to have initial CC clusters (which are visible word-medially, where the CC sequence can be broken up across a syllable boundary) are simplified by deleting the initial consonant when the morpheme occurs word-initially, to avoid complex onsets (perhaps especially because these complex onsets would violate the sonority sequencing principle, which is what makes it hard for students to even imagine that the morphemes have these CC sequences initially!)

Explain what the basic phonological analysis of this dataset is, and what the key pieces of evidence are.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The basic analysis here is that vowels of the same height need to agree in terms of backness. We see this in suffix alternations: there are four alternating suffixes, each with a back and front variant, and two of them have high vowels while two of them have mid vowels. Whenever the suffix comes after a root containing a back vowel at the same height as the suffix, the suffix also contains a back vowel, but when the root contains either a front vowel or a back vowel at a different height, the suffix contains the front vowel. Thus, we posit the front versions as the URs of the suffixes, because they occur in the wider set of contexts, and write a rule of vowel backing that only applies when the target vowel follows a back context vowel of the same height.

{\large Question 4}\\

Source: Day 8 Discussion\\

Briefly explain source-filter theory.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The vocal folds vibrate, setting the air coming from the lungs into motion -- this is the ``source'' sound wave, which is a complex wave, with energy at multiple different frequencies – the fundamental and its harmonics, i.e., its multiples. Then the oral and nasal cavities act as a "filter" to dampen (remove energy from) some of the frequencies of the sound and enhance others (the resonant frequencies). Depending on the shape of the mouth, different frequencies will resonate and so we get different formant values and hence different vowel qualities.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: For any morpheme that doesn’t alternate, its UR should be the same as its SR.

The front-vowel version occurs in the wider / elsewhere set of contexts (after a front vowel and after a back vowel of a different height), so this should be the UR. So in this case, we have the non-alternating root morpheme ‘mix’ /sir/ and the alternating suffix morpheme 'past' /mi/.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The first thing to do is a morphological analysis. There should be morphemes that represent each of the four tenses / aspects (present, past, future, and progressive), and morphemes that represent each root. The morphemes representing the tenses appear as (relatively) consistent forms in the columns; the morphemes representing the roots appear as consistent forms in the rows. Doing this reveals that the final 3 segments in the present forms and the final two segments in the progressive forms are suffixes (there are no zero morphemes, and all components have a one-to-one correspondence). Then we check for alternations. The alternations here are in the suffixes; each of the four suffixes has two forms. There are therefore four alternations, with two allomorphs each. So, what we need to analyze are the alternations in the suffix forms, where we see vowels alternating. Two of the alternations involve [i] and [ɯ], and the other two alternations involve [e] and [ɤ]. In each case, there’s a front vowel and a back vowel, which are otherwise matched for height and rounding, so we can likely generalize across the alternations.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You probably start with procedures that you know work for some other language like Mende, and see whether they work here. In this case, we (1) look at cases of words that have one of the contour tones, because words with only H or only L will just always have a single tone associated with all of the TBUs, but contour tones can help you see e.g. “where” the contour happens; (2) look at cases of words with a mismatch in the number of tones and TBUs (e.g. HL tones and VVV, or LHL tones and VV), because these are cases where one-to-one mapping will fail. By seeing that the “tail” of contours is to the left, not the right (e.g., it’s LLH not LHH) and that in the triple-tone words with two TBUs, we have the contour to the left (LH, then L; not L, then HL), we see that the “leftover” stuff needs to be on the left edge instead of the right edge. Hence, the initial mapping procedure should proceed from right to left instead of left to right.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [n] is higher sonority than [t], and the SSP requires that segments increase in sonority as you get closer to the nucleus and decrease in sonority as you move away; [nte] would involve a dip and then a rise in sonority

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: We need a rule of "Vowel Backing" as follows: [α high, +syllabic] --> [+back] / [α high, +back, +syllabic] C0 \_\_. This rule says that a vowel will become back if it follows another back vowel of the same height, regardless of any intervening consonants. We know this is the rule we need because we need to account for the suffix alternations; the suffixes appear either with a front vowel or a back vowel. The back versions occur only after a back vowel of the same height (so are the focus of the rule); the front vowels occur elsewhere (after a front vowel, or after a back vowel of a different height). We could have two separate rules, one for mid vowels and one for high vowels, but this misses the generalization that these rules are basically doing the same thing.

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

Vowel laxing: /i/ → {[ɪ]} / \{{[ɛ]}, {[ɔ]}\} C$_0$\_\_


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: yes; you're trying to group multiple (in this case, two) sounds together, so it's good to use features to describe their commonality; it also helps us see the naturalness of the rule by pointing out the relevant part of the phonological context

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: For any morpheme that doesn’t alternate, its UR should be the same as its SR.  For the morphemes that alternate, the back-vowel version occurs in the narrower set of contexts (after a back vowel of the same height), so should be the one that we write a rule for. The front-vowel version occurs in the wider / elsewhere set of contexts (after a front vowel and after a back vowel of a different height), so this should be the UR. So in this case, we have the non-alternating root morpheme ‘dig’ /rekɯl/ and the alternating suffix morpheme 'future' /er/.

Briefly explain source-filter theory.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The vocal folds vibrate, setting the air coming from the lungs into motion -- this is the ``source'' sound wave, which is a complex wave, with energy at multiple different frequencies – the fundamental and its harmonics, i.e., its multiples. Then the oral and nasal cavities act as a "filter" to dampen (remove energy from) some of the frequencies of the sound and enhance others (the resonant frequencies). Depending on the shape of the mouth, different frequencies will resonate and so we get different formant values and hence different vowel qualities.

How does syllabification play a role in the analysis of Tibetan numerals?\\

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: morphemes that seem to have initial CC clusters (which are visible word-medially, where the CC sequence can be broken up across a syllable boundary) are simplified by deleting the initial consonant when the morpheme occurs word-initially, to avoid complex onsets (perhaps especially because these complex onsets would violate the sonority sequencing principle, which is what makes it hard for students to even imagine that the morphemes have these CC sequences initially!)

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\

This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants ``pinched'' together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

Explain which of the three rules will apply to the form given below, and whether each of those rules would have an effect or not.\\

Peng’s Tone-Mapping Procedure for Mende: \begin{enumerate} \item L-to-R association: Associate the first tone to the first TBU, the second tone to the second TBU, and so on, until all tones or all TBUS are exhausted. \item Last-TBU Linking: Associate any remaining unlinked tones to the last TBU. \item Last-Tone Linking: Associate the last tone to any TBU without a tone. \end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/mendetone_d.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: L-to-R association applies, and links the first three tones (H L H) to the first three TBUs ([a], [u], [e]). Then last-TBU linking applies and links the leftover L tone to the last TBU ([e]). Last-tone linking will not apply because there are no leftover TBUs.
