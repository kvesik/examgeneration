34785	Other (pre-midterm)	medium	Day 3 Handout, Question 2(iv)	Explain how you would figure out the Swahili word for this English gloss. (To be clear: you do NOT necessarily need to give me the Swahili form itself -- just explain the process of figuring it out.)\\~\\‘I like you (sg.).’~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/swahiliverbs.png} \end{figure}~\\	swahiliverbs.png			
34785	Acoustics	hard	Day 8 Handout, Question 6	Explain what you see in the spectrogram that tells you about the properties of the sounds in the pictured word.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/spectrogram_suit.png} \end{figure}~\\	spectrogram_suit.png			
90811	Acoustics	medium	Day 8 Handout, Question 7	State whether each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\$^{10}$\ul{Frequency is inversely related to pitch: high frequencies correspond to low pitches, and low frequencies correspond to high pitches.} Finally, there is the amplitude of the wave. $^{11}$\ul{The amplitude tells you how much pressure the molecules are under at any particular time.} $^{12}$\ul{The auditory correlate of amplitude is intensity}; this is a measure of perceived pressure.\\\\$^{13}$\ul{In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs} are the source of most speech sounds.~\\ 				
90811	Phonological Features	hard	Day 10 Handout, Question 6 (Homework 3, Question 2)	Explain how you should use phonological features in this rule. Which parts of the rule should include features, and what features might they be? You don't have to give an exact set of features, but what kinds of features would be involved?\\~\\/æ/ → {[eʌ]} / \_\_ \{{[m]},{[n]}\}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/english_aeraising.png} \end{figure}~\\	english_aeraising.png			
94675	Acoustics	hard	Day 8 Discussion	Briefly explain source-filter theory.\\~\\ 				
94675	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	medium	Quiz 5, Question 2	State what kind of phonological relationship is shown between the sounds [o] and [a] and explain how you know.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/peng70ao_b.png} \end{figure}~\\	peng70ao_b.png			
38415	Skewed Distributions	hard	Day 4 Handout, Question 7	Explain how you would go about looking for co-occurrence restrictions in bi-syllabic signs in ASL. (Refer to the data that follows.)\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ASL_movement.png} \end{figure}~\\	ASL_movement.png

72428	Tone	medium	Day 12 Handout, Question 5	Explain which of the three rules will apply to the form given below, and whether each of those rules would have an effect or not.\\~\\Peng’s Tone-Mapping Procedure for Mende: \begin{enumerate} \item L-to-R association: Associate the first tone to the first TBU, the second tone to the second TBU, and so on, until all tones or all TBUS are exhausted. \item Leftover-tone Linking: Associate any remaining unlinked tones to the last TBU. \item Leftover-TBU Linking: Associate the last tone to any TBU without a tone. \end{enumerate}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/mendetone_c.png} \end{figure}~\\	mendetone_c.png			
72428	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Day 2 Handout, Part II, Question 3	Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\~\\Original set: {[ɛ]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ʊ]}, {[ɔ]}~\\Addition: {[ɑ]}~\\ 				
54125	Acoustics	hard	n/a	Explain what would be similar and different about the sounds pictured and how you can tell from the pictures.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/vowel_spectra.png} \end{figure}~\\	vowel_spectra.png			
54125	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	medium	Day 7 Handout, Question 2	Explain whether the rule below would apply to the form shown, and if so, what the effect of the rule would be. Assume the vowel inventory [i], [ɪ], [e], [ɛ], [ɑ], [u], [ʊ], [o], [ɔ]. If the rule doesn't apply, explain why it doesn't.\\~\\/esʊm/~\\{[non-low vowel]} --> {[lax]} / \_\_ C$_0$ {[lax vowel]}~\\
