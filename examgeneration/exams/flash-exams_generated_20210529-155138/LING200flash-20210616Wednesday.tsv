74752	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	hard	Day 6 Handout, Question 1	Explain why it is possible to predict whether a plain or aspirated voiceless stop will occur in a new context (in English), but not to predict the place of articulation of a voiceless stop in a new context.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/aspiration.png} \end{figure}~\\	aspiration.png

33446	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	medium	Day 6 Handout, Question 6	Is the statement given below a good description of the distribution of sounds in this dataset? Why or why not?\\~\\The sounds {[l]} and {[ɾ]} are in overlapping distribution, but just occur as pronunciation variants of the same morpheme, as in {[mul]} ‘water’ and {[muɾe]} ‘at the water.’ Thus, we know that these sounds are in free variation.~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/korean.png} \end{figure}~\\	korean.png

27762	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	hard	Day 6 Handout, Question 1	Would you expect [ʔ] to follow the same pattern of occurring as plain or aspirated as is followed by [p] and [t] and [k]?
