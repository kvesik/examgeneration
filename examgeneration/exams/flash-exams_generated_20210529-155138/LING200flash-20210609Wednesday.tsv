44715	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Day 2 Discussion	Assuming a Standard North American English inventory, does this vowel need to have tenseness specified if you're giving a prose description? Why or why not?\\~\\{[u]}~\\ 				
44715	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	hard	Day 6 Handout, Question 1	Explain why it is possible to predict whether a plain or aspirated voiceless stop will occur in a new context (in English), but not to predict the place of articulation of a voiceless stop in a new context.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/aspiration.png} \end{figure}~\\	aspiration.png

99594	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Day 2 Handout, Part II, Question 13	Explain why this image does or does not match the description.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item A two-handed sign. \item Location: In front of signer’s chin. \item Handshape: Starts with an “L” shape; index finger and thumb come together during the sign. \item Movement: Hands start crossed and then move away from each other horizontally. \end{itemize}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/taiwansign_fit.png} \caption{FIT} \end{figure}~\\	taiwansign_fit.png	FIT		
99594	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	hard	Day 6 Handout, Question 1	Would you expect [ʔ] to follow the same pattern of occurring as plain or aspirated as is followed by [p] and [t] and [k]?

62089	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 3, Question 2	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tri-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tri-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$?

60467	Skewed Distributions	hard	Day 4 Handout, Question 5	Explain why looking for patterns with consonants and vowels is a more reasonable approach to pattern finding in this dataset than looking for patterns with respect to all of the individual sounds in Ukrainian.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png
