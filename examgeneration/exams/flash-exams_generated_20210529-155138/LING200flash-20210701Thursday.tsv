54112	Tone	medium	Day 12 Handout, Question 5	Explain which of the three rules will apply to the form given below, and whether each of those rules would have an effect or not.\\~\\Peng’s Tone-Mapping Procedure for Mende: \begin{enumerate} \item L-to-R association: Associate the first tone to the first TBU, the second tone to the second TBU, and so on, until all tones or all TBUS are exhausted. \item Leftover-tone Linking: Associate any remaining unlinked tones to the last TBU. \item Leftover-TBU Linking: Associate the last tone to any TBU without a tone. \end{enumerate}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/mendetone_a.png} \end{figure}~\\	mendetone_a.png

89930	Phonological Relationships and Analysis	medium	Day 7 Handout, Question 2	Explain whether the rule below would apply to the form shown, and if so, what the effect of the rule would be. Assume the vowel inventory [i], [ɪ], [e], [ɛ], [ɑ], [u], [ʊ], [o], [ɔ]. If the rule doesn't apply, explain why it doesn't.\\~\\/emus/~\\{[high vowel]} --> {[unround, front]} / {[front vowel]} C$_0$ \_\_\_~\\ 				
89930	Alternations	hard	n/a	Explain how the concept of "free variation" is both similar to and different from the concept of an "alternation."\\~\\ 				
97077	Acoustics	medium	Day 8 Handout, Question 7	State whether each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs are the source of most speech sounds. $^{14}$\ul{The basic rate of vibration is called the fundamental frequency}; $^{15}$\ul{the fundamental frequency is also known as the timbre of the voice.} In addition to the source, we can also talk about a filter: $^{16}$\ul{the vocal folds act as a filter to shape the air from the lungs into the sounds we hear as different.} $^{17}$\ul{The mouth and nose act as resonance chambers}, and these also affect the qualities of the sounds.~\\ 				
97077	Transcription	hard	Day 2 Handout	Is this a reasonable transcription of this word? Explain why.\\~\\<philosophy>: {[fəlɑsəfi]}~\\
