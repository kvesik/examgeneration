{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Skewed Distributions\\
Source: Quiz 4, Question 1\\

L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\

\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You would start by coming up with all the possible combinations expected (i.e., 4x4 = 16). Then you'd compare that to some database of signs in ASL and see which combinations are actually attested or unattested.

Topic: Acoustics\\
Source: Week 9 Handout, Question 4\\

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\

This consonant is characterized by having a lot of random noise in the spectrogram, with no clear formant structure at all. It tends to be longer and louder than other similar consonants. There is no voice bar, and the majority of the noise created by this consonant is at relatively high frequencies.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [s]; check for voicing, place, and manner

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: I: clear formants; all dark, so just a vowel; changes so a diphthong; F1 pretty high and then falls a bit (=starts as low V and goes higher); F2 starts pretty low and then goes up (=starts as back V and goes fronter)
