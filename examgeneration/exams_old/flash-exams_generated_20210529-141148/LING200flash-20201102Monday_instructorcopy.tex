Topic: Skewed Distributions\\

Explain how you would go about looking for co-occurrence restrictions in bi-syllabic signs in ASL. (Refer to the data that follows.)\\

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You would start by coming up with all the possible combinations expected (i.e., 4x4 = 16). Then you'd compare that to some database of signs in ASL and see which combinations are actually attested or unattested.

Explain why looking for patterns with consonants and vowels is a more reasonable approach to pattern finding in this dataset than looking for patterns with respect to all of the individual sounds in Ukrainian.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Collapsing sounds into "consonants" and "vowels" allows us to have 'sufficient data' in a way that thinking about all the individual combinations of sounds would not.

Is this question about phonetics or phonology, and why? (To be clear: you do NOT need to answer the question itself -- just tell me whether it's a question about phonetics or phonology.)\\

How would you describe the difference between the vowel in the word <heat> and the vowel in the word <hat>?

Topic: Articulatory Phonetics\\

Assuming a Standard North American English inventory, does this vowel need to have tenseness specified if you're giving a prose description? Why or why not?\\

{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Week 4 Discussion\\

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).
