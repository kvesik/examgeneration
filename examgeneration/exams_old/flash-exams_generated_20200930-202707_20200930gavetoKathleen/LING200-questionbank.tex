\begin{figure}[H]

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Short and long vowels appear to be contrastive (phonemic) in Malayalam, as evidenced by minimal pairs that differ only in terms of their vowel length, such as [koʈːa] ‘basket’ vs. [koːʈːa] ‘castle’ or [keʈːu] ‘burnt out’ vs. [keːʈːu] ‘heard.’

What is the basic analysis of voiceless stops in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/english11.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Plain and aspirated voiceless stops are in complementary distribution in English. Plain stops occur always and only after [s], as in [speɪs] ‘space,’ while aspirated stops never occur in this context. Meanwhile, aspirated stops occur word-initially (e.g., [phitʃ] ‘peach’) and between vowels (e.g., [əphɑɹt] ‘apart’). Because the two are in complementary distribution, we can always predict which one occurs in any given environment, and so we conclude that they are allophonic, i.e., allophones of the same phoneme category.

What is the basic analysis of oral and nasal vowels in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/english12.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The pairs of sounds [i] and [ĩ], and [u] and [ũ], are each allophonic and therefore allophones of the same phoneme in English (though the two pairs represent two contrastive phonemes in English). The sounds [i] and [ĩ] are in complementary distribution in English, with [ĩ] occurring before the sounds [m] and [n], (e.g., [ɡlĩm] ‘gleam’ and [klĩn] ‘clean’) and [i] occurring elsewhere (e.g., [lip] ‘leap’). Similarly, the sounds [u] and [ũ] are also in complementary distribution, with exactly the same conditioning environments: [ũ] occurs before [m] and [n] (e.g., [dũm] ‘doom’ and [dũn] ‘dune’), and [u] occurs elsewhere (e.g. [but] ‘boot’). Thus, within each pair, we treat the vowels as allophonic.

Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.\\

We should posit /r/ as the underlying form, and have a rule that devoices it when it occurs after voiceless segments. This analysis is best because it requires only one rule with a single environment to account for all the occurrences of both {[r]} and {[r̥]}; the plain {[r]} sounds result from non-application of the rule.

Explain why the statement below either is or is not a good analysis of the data.\\

We should posit /r̥/ as the underlying form, and have a rule that voices it when it occurs after voiced segments or word-initially. This analysis is best because it puts the more unusual sound, the voiceless {[r̥]}, into the underlying representation, which has to be memorized anyway.

\begin{figure}[H]

Then the oral and nasal cavities act as a "filter" to dampen (remove energy from) some of the frequencies of the sound and enhance others (the resonant frequencies). Depending on the shape of the mouth, different frequencies will resonate and so we get different formant values and hence different vowel qualities.

{\large Question 1} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\

This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.

~\\

{\large Question 2} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\

This consonant is characterized by having a clear voice bar and its own formants (at around 250 Hz, 2500 Hz, and 3250 Hz). These formants, however, are not as intense as they would be if they were vowel formants. The effect on the formants of the adjacent vowel is usually relatively small; the second formant of the vowel will probably be around 1750 Hz.

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\

This consonant is characterized by having a lot of random noise in the spectrogram, with no clear formant structure at all. It tends to be longer and louder than other similar consonants.

Sound is an invisible phenomenon.

Sound is a particular kind of wave known as a compression wave.... $^6$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, they try to spread out as far as possible, and that’s why they move out as a wave.}\\\\There are several key components of a sound wave. The first is wavelength. $^7$\ul{Wavelength is the distance between the point of maximum rarefaction and the point of maximum compression in a wave.} Another component that is related to wavelength is $^8$\ul{frequency, or how many times a wave passes through a particular point in one second.} $^9$\ul{If the wavelength is really short, the frequency will be really high; if the wavelength is really long, the frequency will be really low.} 


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: 6 - false (the molecules always try to stay an equal distance from each other, so they move apart when they are compressed and together when they are rarefied).\\7 - false (wavelength is the distance between two points of maximum compression or rarefaction in a wave).\\8 - true.\\9 - true.

Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs are the source of most speech sounds. $^{14}$\ul{The basic rate of vibration is called the fundamental frequency}; $^{15}$\ul{the fundamental frequency is also known as the timbre of the voice.} In addition to the source, we can also talk about a filter: $^{16}$\ul{the vocal folds act as a filter to shape the air from the lungs into the sounds we hear as different.} $^{17}$\ul{The mouth and nose act as resonance chambers}, and these also affect the qualities of the sounds.

We can visualize speech through the use of spectra and spectrograms. $^{18}$\ul{A spectrogram shows frequency on the horizontal axis and amplitude on the vertical axis.} $^{19}$\ul{A spectrum, on the other hand, shows frequency on the vertical axis and time along the horizontal axis}.\\\\$^{20}$\ul{On a spectrogram, the dark bars are called formants.} $^{21}$\ul{The formants correspond to the amplitude peaks on a spectrum.}

We can look at the vertical location of the formants to determine something about the characteristics of individual speech sounds. For example, in the two spectrograms below, we can see that $^{22}$\ul{the first formant is higher in the spectrogram for sound 1 than it is for sound 2.} Because $^{23}$\ul{F1 is directly correlated with vowel height}, we know that $^{24}$\ul{the vowel pictured in sound 1 is a higher vowel than the one in sound 2}. For example, $^{25}$\ul{sound 1 might be an {[ɑ]} while sound 2 might be an {[i]}.}

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

Explain why the sonority sequencing principle would block the syllabification of [n] and [t] of [n.ta] into one syllable in Ponapean.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [n] is higher sonority than [t], and the SSP requires that segments increase in sonority as you get closer to the nucleus and decrease in sonority as you move away; [nte] would involve a dip and then a rise in sonority

{\large Question 1} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Explain the key differences between the templatic and the rule-based approaches to syllabification.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: in the rule-based approach, you ONLY have rules, so you don't know ahead of time what possible syllable types you might get; you also need to know which rules apply in a language and what the order of the rules is -- but in the templatic approach, you have a template that tells you ahead of time what the possible syllable types are, and you use the template in conjunction with rules; in the templatic approach, you also need to know the direction of syllabification (L to R or R to L), not the order of the rules [Note: should not mention anything about the units used in either approach)

How does syllabification play a role in the analysis of the phonological relationship between tense and lax high vowels in Quebec French?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/quebecfrench.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: here, syllabification must precede the rest of the analysis; the tense vowels ([i] and [u]) occur in open syllables, while the lax vowels occur in closed syllables -- so e.g. we might have a rule of vowel laxing that says [+high, +syll] --> [-tense] / \_\_ C., with a period to specifically mark the syllable boundary in the context of the rule

How does syllabification play a role in the analysis of Tibetan numerals?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/tibetan.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: morphemes that seem to have initial CC clusters (which are visible word-medially, where the CC sequence can be broken up across a syllable boundary) are simplified by deleting the initial consonant when the morpheme occurs word-initially, to avoid complex onsets (perhaps especially because these complex onsets would violate the sonority sequencing principle, which is what makes it hard for students to even imagine that the morphemes have these CC sequences initially!)

Explain why the insertion analysis is better than the deletion analysis for this dataset.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/fula.png}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: If you have /VC/ as the underlying form of these suffixes, there’s no reason to delete the vowel, because you'd have perfect CV syllables throughout the word. But if you have /C/ as the underlying form, it’s clear that we occasionally need an extra vowel in order to allow syllabification to happen; otherwise, we’d end up with non-syllabifiable CCC sequences. That is, there’s a phonological motivation for the insertion rule, but no motivation for the deletion rule.

We see that these are the five basic patterns of tone, and they can get stretched out or squished together, but there are all five, so we assume that these are the tonal invntory. For any actual word, we take its segments and combine it (without associaton lines) with the appropriate tonal category.

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You probably start with procedures that you know work for some other language like Mende, and see whether they work here. In this case, we (1) look at cases of words that have one of the contour tones, because words with only H or only L will just always have a single tone associated with all of the TBUs, but contour tones can help you see e.g. “where” the contour happens; (2) look at cases of words with a mismatch in the number of tones and TBUs (e.g. HL tones and VVV, or LHL tones and VV), because these are cases where one-to-one mapping will fail. By seeing that the “tail” of contours is to the left, not the right (e.g., it’s LLH not LHH) and that in the triple-tone words with two TBUs, we have the contour to the left (LH, then L; not L, then HL), we see that the “leftover” stuff needs to be on the left edge instead of the right edge. Hence, the initial mapping procedure should proceed from right to left instead of left to right.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You probably start with procedures that you know work for some other language like Mende, and see whether they work here; in this case, there's only one underlying tone in each word, and it gets linked to every TBU, so you probably just need something like initial linking and then Leftover-TBU linking (there will never be any leftover tones)

{\large Question 1} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Explain how you would go about figuring out what to analyse in this dataset.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The first thing to do is a morphological analysis. There should be morphemes that represent each of the four tenses / aspects (present, past, future, and progressive), and morphemes that represent each root. The morphemes representing the tenses appear as (relatively) consistent forms in the columns; the morphemes representing the roots appear as consistent forms in the rows. Doing this reveals that the final 3 segments in the present forms and the final two segments in the progressive forms are suffixes (there are no zero morphemes, and all components have a one-to-one correspondence). Then we check for alternations. The alternations here are in the suffixes; each of the four suffixes has two forms. There are therefore four alternations, with two allomorphs each. So, what we need to analyze are the alternations in the suffix forms, where we see vowels alternating. Two of the alternations involve [i] and [ɯ], and the other two alternations involve [e] and [ɤ]. In each case, there’s a front vowel and a back vowel, which are otherwise matched for height and rounding, so we can likely generalize across the alternations.

{\large Question 2} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Give a good phonological description of the patterns in the dataset that should be analysed.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: For each morpheme that alternates, there are two allomorphs, one with a front vowel and one with a back vowel. The allomorph with the back vowel occurs after another back vowel of the same height (e.g., [fɯd] in [jɤɡɯd-fɯd] ‘swallow, present’ or [sɤ] in [mikɤv-sɤ] ‘search, progressive’), regardless of any intervening consonants. The allomorph with the front vowel occurs elsewhere, including after a front vowel (e.g. [fid] in [sat-fid] ‘chew, present’ or [se] in [sat-se] ‘chew, progressive’) and after a back vowel of a different height (e.g. [fid] in [mikɤv-fid] ‘search, present’ or [se] in [jɤɡɯd-se] ‘swallow, progressive’). Again, these latter environments are regardless of any intervening consonants.

{\large Question 3} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Explain what the underlying representation of these morphemes would be and why.\\

`search', `present'

\begin{figure}[H]

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: For any morpheme that doesn’t alternate, its UR should be the same as its SR.  For the morphemes that alternate, the back-vowel version occurs in the narrower set of contexts (after a back vowel of the same height), so should be the one that we write a rule for. The front-vowel version occurs in the wider / elsewhere set of contexts (after a front vowel and after a back vowel of a different height), so this should be the UR. So in this case, we have the non-alternating root morpheme ‘search’ /mikɤv/ and the alternating suffix morpheme 'present' /fid/.

{\large Question 7} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Explain what rule or rules would apply in this dataset and how you know.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: We need a rule of "Vowel Backing" as follows: [α high, +syllabic] --> [+back] / [α high, +back, +syllabic] C0 \_\_. This rule says that a vowel will become back if it follows another back vowel of the same height, regardless of any intervening consonants. We know this is the rule we need because we need to account for the suffix alternations; the suffixes appear either with a front vowel or a back vowel. The back versions occur only after a back vowel of the same height (so are the focus of the rule); the front vowels occur elsewhere (after a front vowel, or after a back vowel of a different height). We could have two separate rules, one for mid vowels and one for high vowels, but this misses the generalization that these rules are basically doing the same thing.


~\\

{\large Question 8} (completed -nodate-) - Source: \\

Explain what the basic phonological analysis of this dataset is, and what the key pieces of evidence are.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The basic analysis here is that vowels of the same height need to agree in terms of backness. We see this in suffix alternations: there are four alternating suffixes, each with a back and front variant, and two of them have high vowels while two of them have mid vowels. Whenever the suffix comes after a root containing a back vowel at the same height as the suffix, the suffix also contains a back vowel, but when the root contains either a front vowel or a back vowel at a different height, the suffix contains the front vowel. Thus, we posit the front versions as the URs of the suffixes, because they occur in the wider set of contexts, and write a rule of vowel backing that only applies when the target vowel follows a back context vowel of the same height.
