{\large Question 1}\\

Is this a reasonable transcription of this word? Explain why.\\

{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Homework 2, Question 1\\

Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\

{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[e]}, {[ɛ]}, {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}, {[ɔ]}, {[o]}, {[ʊ]}, {[u]}, {[ʒ]}, {[k]}, {[ɡ]}, {[ŋ]}, {[w]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: [ʒ] should be removed, so that we have the natural class of dorsal segments; this could be minimally represented with [DORSAL]

{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Skewed Distributions\\
Source: Week 5 Handout, Question 6\\

If I gave you a new word in Malto, [di\_\_u], would it be possible to predict whether it's [d] or [t] that goes in the blank? Explain why or why not.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/malto.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: No, it's not possible. In Malto, you can predict that there are two dental or two retroflex stops in a word, but you can't predict the voicing. These two sounds are both dental, so there's no way to predict.

{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Articulatory Phonetics\\
Source: Week 3 Handout, Question 3\\

Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[æ]}, {[ɑ]}

Addition: {[ɑʊ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class

{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Acoustics\\
Source: Week 9 Handout, Question 7\\

Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

Sound is an invisible phenomenon. Sound can travel through any substance, $^1$\ul{such as a liquid, solid, or a gas.} $^2$\ul{It involves the transfer of the matter in that substance} from one place to another.\\\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as $^3$\ul{a compression wave}. $^4$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, we say they are ``rarefied'' and when they are really far apart, we say they are ``compressed.''}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: 1 - true.\\2 - false (it involves the transfer of energy... or anything about the matter itself not moving but only vibrating, etc). \\3 - true.\\4 - false (when the molecules are really close together, we say they are compressed and when the molecules are really far apart, we say they are rarefied).
