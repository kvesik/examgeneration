{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Articulatory Phonetics\\
Source: Week 3 Handout, Question 3\\

Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[u]}, {[ʊ]}, {[oʊ]}, {[ɔ]}

Addition: {[ɔɪ]}

{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Skewed Distributions\\
Source: Quiz 4, Question 3\\

L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tetra-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tetra-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\

\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i...u...u]} \item {[a...a...i...i]} \item {[u...u...u...u]} \item {[i...i...i...a]} \end{itemize}

Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\

{[v]}, {[z]}, {[ʃ]}, {[ʒ]}, {[ð]}
