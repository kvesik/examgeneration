Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Homework 2, Question 1\\

Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\

Topic: Acoustics\\
Source: Week 9 Handout, Question 7\\

Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs are the source of most speech sounds. $^{14}$\ul{The basic rate of vibration is called the fundamental frequency}; $^{15}$\ul{the fundamental frequency is also known as the timbre of the voice.} In addition to the source, we can also talk about a filter: $^{16}$\ul{the vocal folds act as a filter to shape the air from the lungs into the sounds we hear as different.} $^{17}$\ul{The mouth and nose act as resonance chambers}, and these also affect the qualities of the sounds.

$^{10}$\ul{Frequency is inversely related to pitch: high frequencies correspond to low pitches, and low frequencies correspond to high pitches.} Finally, there is the amplitude of the wave. $^{11}$\ul{The amplitude tells you how much pressure the molecules are under at any particular time.} $^{12}$\ul{The auditory correlate of amplitude is intensity}; this is a measure of perceived pressure.\\\\$^{13}$\ul{In speech, air is set in vibrating motion by the lungs, so the lungs} are the source of most speech sounds.
