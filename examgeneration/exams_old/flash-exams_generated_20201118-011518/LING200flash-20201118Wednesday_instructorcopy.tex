Topic: Skewed Distributions\\
Source: Quiz 4, Question 1\\

L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\

\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\

This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.

Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

Sound is an invisible phenomenon. Sound can travel through any substance, $^1$\ul{such as a liquid, solid, or a gas.} $^2$\ul{It involves the transfer of the matter in that substance} from one place to another.\\\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as $^3$\ul{a compression wave}. $^4$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, we say they are ``rarefied'' and when they are really far apart, we say they are ``compressed.''}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: 1 - true.\\2 - false (it involves the transfer of energy... or anything about the matter itself not moving but only vibrating, etc). \\3 - true.\\4 - false (when the molecules are really close together, we say they are compressed and when the molecules are really far apart, we say they are rarefied).

{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Acoustics\\
Source: Week 9 Discussion\\

Briefly explain source-filter theory.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The vocal folds vibrate, setting the air coming from the lungs into motion -- this is the "source" sound wave, which is a complex wave, with energy at multiple different frequencies – the fundamental and its harmonics, i.e., its multiples. Then the oral and nasal cavities act as a "filter" to dampen (remove energy from) some of the frequencies of the sound and enhance others (the resonant frequencies). Depending on the shape of the mouth, different frequencies will resonate and so we get different formant values and hence different vowel qualities.
