{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Week 4 Discussion\\

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Other (pre-midterm)\\
Source: Week 2 Handout, Part I, Question 8\\

Is this question about phonetics or phonology, and why? (To be clear: you do NOT need to answer the question itself -- just tell me whether it's a question about phonetics or phonology.)\\

Consider the following two words from American Sign Language. The first one means LUCKY, while the second means SMART. How would you describe the difference between the ``pronunciation'' (articulation) of these two words? Note that in each case, the image to the left is the starting position of the sign, while the one to the right is the ending position.
