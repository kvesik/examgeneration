Is this question about phonetics or phonology, and why? (To be clear: you do NOT need to answer the question itself -- just tell me whether it's a question about phonetics or phonology.)\\

In a word like ``syllable'' there is a main stress on the first syllable of the word. Where do you think the main stress would go in each of the following words? What are the possible choices? How does the pronunciation of the words change with different stress patterns? \begin{itemize} \item Pataskala (a town in Ohio) \item Menomini (an Algonquin language spoken by the Menomini people of northern Wisconsin) \item allophony \item Chickasha (a town in Wisconsin) \end{itemize}
