55466	Articulatory Phonetics	easy	Week 3 Handout, Question 7	Is the symbol given a reasonable way to transcribe any of the sounds described below? If so, which one? If not, why not?\\~\\{[ʒ]}~\\\begin{itemize} \item voiceless palatal affricate \item voiced velar nasal \item voiceless glottal fricative \item voiced labiodental fricative \item voiced interdental fricative \item voiced palatal fricative \end{itemize}~\\ 				
55466	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 2	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. L$_X$ has tri-syllabic roots. If L$_X$ does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur, which one of the following tri-syllabic vocalic sequences do you predict to be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[u...i...a]} \item {[a...i...a]} \item {[u...u...a]} \item {[a...i...i]} \end{itemize}~\\ 				
55466	Phonological Features	hard		Explain how you should use phonological features in this rule. Which parts of the rule should include features, and what features might they be? You don't have to give an exact set of features, but what kinds of features would be involved?\\~\\/t/ → {[ɾ]} / \{{[vowel]},{[syllabic consonant]}\} \_\_ \{{[vowel]},{[syllabic consonant]}\}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/english_t_flap.png} \end{figure}~\\	english_t_flap.png

84480	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\

85868	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Week 3 Handout, Question 13	Explain why this image does or does not match the description.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item A one-handed sign. \item Location: At the signer’s nose. \item Handshape: Starts with index finger extended; finger folds down into a “hook” shape during the sign; then straightens and repeats the folding. \item Movement: No movement other than the change in handshape. \end{itemize}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/taiwansign_wrong.png} \caption{WRONG} \end{figure}~\\	taiwansign_wrong.png	WRONG		
85868	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 5	Explain why looking for patterns with consonants and vowels is a more reasonable approach to pattern finding in this dataset than looking for patterns with respect to all of the individual sounds in Ukrainian.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ukrainian.png} \end{figure}~\\	ukrainian.png			
85868	Transcription	easy	Quiz 1, Question 10	Explain whether this word either does or does not have an [ʃ] sound in it, and why the spelling and pronunciation either do or do not align.\\~\\<meticulous>~\\ 				
85868	Phonological Features	medium		Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class, and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ɛ]}, {[u]}, {[ʊ]}~\\
