{\large Question 1}\\

Topic: Acoustics\\
Source: Week 9 Handout, Question 7\\

Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

Sound is a particular kind of wave known as a compression wave.... $^6$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, they try to spread out as far as possible, and that’s why they move out as a wave.}\\\\There are several key components of a sound wave. The first is wavelength. $^7$\ul{Wavelength is the distance between the point of maximum rarefaction and the point of maximum compression in a wave.} Another component that is related to wavelength is $^8$\ul{frequency, or how many times a wave passes through a particular point in one second.} $^9$\ul{If the wavelength is really short, the frequency will be really high; if the wavelength is really long, the frequency will be really low.} 


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: 6 - false (the molecules always try to stay an equal distance from each other, so they move apart when they are compressed and together when they are rarefied).\\7 - false (wavelength is the distance between two points of maximum compression or rarefaction in a wave).\\8 - true.\\9 - true.

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

Sound is an invisible phenomenon. Sound can travel through any substance, $^1$\ul{such as a liquid, solid, or a gas.} $^2$\ul{It involves the transfer of the matter in that substance} from one place to another.\\\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as $^3$\ul{a compression wave}. $^4$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, we say they are ``rarefied'' and when they are really far apart, we say they are ``compressed.''}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: 1 - true.\\2 - false (it involves the transfer of energy... or anything about the matter itself not moving but only vibrating, etc). \\3 - true.\\4 - false (when the molecules are really close together, we say they are compressed and when the molecules are really far apart, we say they are rarefied).

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: No, it's not possible. In Malto, you can predict that there are two dental or two retroflex stops in a word, but you can't predict the voicing. These two sounds are both dental, so there's no way to predict.
