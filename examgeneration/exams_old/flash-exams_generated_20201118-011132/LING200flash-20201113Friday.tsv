45248	Acoustics	hard	Week 9 Handout, Question 6	Explain what you see in the spectrogram that tells you about the properties of the sounds in the pictured word.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/spectrogram_suit.png} \end{figure}~\\	spectrogram_suit.png			
45248	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[i]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ɛ]}, {[u]}, {[ʊ]}~\\ 				
99531	Other (pre-midterm)	medium	Week 4 Handout, Part II, Question 2(iv)	Explain how you would figure out the Swahili word for this English gloss. (To be clear: you do NOT need to give me the Swahili form itself -- just explain the process of figuring it out.)\\~\\‘I wanted them.’~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/swahiliverbs.png} \end{figure}~\\	swahiliverbs.png			
99531	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Week 3 Handout, Question 3	Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\~\\Original set: {[ɛ]}, {[ɪ]}, {[ʊ]}, {[ɔ]}~\\Addition: {[æ]}~\\ 				
51191	Phonological Features	medium	Week 4 Discussion	Explain what the given feature’s value is for this class of sounds, and why.\\~\\{[consonantal]}~\\glides~\\ 				
51191	Articulatory Phonetics	hard	Homework 1, Question 3(a)	Could this image be the result of producing the sound represented by the given IPA symbol? Why or why not?\\~\\{[z]}~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/staticpalatography_fricative.png} \end{figure}~\\	staticpalatography_fricative.png			
11925	Acoustics	hard	Week 9 Handout, Question 5	Explain what would be similar and different about the sounds pictured and how you can tell from the pictures.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/vowel_spectra.png} \end{figure}~\\	vowel_spectra.png			
11925	Transcription	medium	Week 2 Handout, Part II, Question 11	How would this word be transcribed?\\ (Kathleen will then ask a follow-up question about your transcription.)\\~\\<juice>~\\ 				
43736	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 7	Explain how you would go about looking for co-occurrence restrictions in bi-syllabic signs in ASL. (Refer to the data that follows.)\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ASL_movement.png} \end{figure}~\\	ASL_movement.png			
43736	Articulatory Phonetics	medium	Week 3 Discussion	Assuming a Standard North American English inventory, does this vowel need to have tenseness specified if you're giving a prose description? Why or why not?\\~\\{[æ]}~\\ 				
74115	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\ 				
74115	Phonological Features	hard	Quiz 3, Question 12	Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/dutch.png} \end{figure}~\\	dutch.png
