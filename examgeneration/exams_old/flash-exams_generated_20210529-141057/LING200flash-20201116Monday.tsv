67535	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 7	Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\Sound is an invisible phenomenon. Sound can travel through any substance, $^1$\ul{such as a liquid, solid, or a gas.} $^2$\ul{It involves the transfer of the matter in that substance} from one place to another.\\\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as $^3$\ul{a compression wave}. $^4$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, we say they are ``rarefied'' and when they are really far apart, we say they are ``compressed.''}~\\
