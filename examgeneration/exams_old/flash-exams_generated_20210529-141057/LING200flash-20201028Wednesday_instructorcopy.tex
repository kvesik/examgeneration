{\large Question 2}\\

Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Week 4 Discussion\\

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You would start by coming up with all the possible combinations expected (i.e., 4x4 = 16). Then you'd compare that to some database of signs in ASL and see which combinations are actually attested or unattested.
