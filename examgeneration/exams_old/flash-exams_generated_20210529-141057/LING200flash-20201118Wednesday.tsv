61058	Skewed Distributions	medium	Quiz 4, Question 1	L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\~\\\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}~\\

33428	Skewed Distributions	hard	Week 5 Handout, Question 7	Explain how you would go about looking for co-occurrence restrictions in bi-syllabic signs in ASL. (Refer to the data that follows.)\\~\\\begin{figure}[H] \includegraphics{../images/ASL_movement.png} \end{figure}~\\	ASL_movement.png			
56051	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 4	Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described.\\~\\This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.~\\

40922	Phonological Features	medium	Homework 2, Question 1	Explain which sound should be removed to make this a natural class (assuming SNAE, except that there are no diphthongs, no [ə] or [ʌ], no syllabic consonants, and no [w̥]), and what the minimum set of features would be to describe the resulting natural class.\\~\\{[v]}, {[z]}, {[ʃ]}, {[ʒ]}, {[ð]}~\\

48894	Acoustics	medium	Week 9 Handout, Question 7	Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\~\\Sound is an invisible phenomenon. Sound can travel through any substance, $^1$\ul{such as a liquid, solid, or a gas.} $^2$\ul{It involves the transfer of the matter in that substance} from one place to another.\\\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as $^3$\ul{a compression wave}. $^4$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, we say they are ``rarefied'' and when they are really far apart, we say they are ``compressed.''}~\\
