Explain why each numbered, underlined statement is true or false. If it is false, explain one way that you could correct it.\\

Sound is an invisible phenomenon. Sound can travel through any substance, $^1$\ul{such as a liquid, solid, or a gas.} $^2$\ul{It involves the transfer of the matter in that substance} from one place to another.\\\\Sound is a particular kind of wave known as $^3$\ul{a compression wave}. $^4$\ul{When the molecules are really close together, we say they are ``rarefied'' and when they are really far apart, we say they are ``compressed.''}
