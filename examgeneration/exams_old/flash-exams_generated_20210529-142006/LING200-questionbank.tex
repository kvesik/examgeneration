Explain why the additional vowel below either does or does not belong in the phonetic natural class defined by the original set of SNAE vowels.\\

Original set: {[u]}, {[ʊ]}, {[oʊ]}, {[ɔ]}

Addition: {[ɔɪ]}


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: should recognize that there's more than one vowel sound, which makes it somewhat difficult to categorize; best answers will say that the diphthong is crucially a diphthong and so can't also go in this class

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/english12.png}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The pairs of sounds [i] and [ĩ], and [u] and [ũ], are each allophonic and therefore allophones of the same phoneme in English (though the two pairs represent two contrastive phonemes in English). The sounds [i] and [ĩ] are in complementary distribution in English, with [ĩ] occurring before the sounds [m] and [n], (e.g., [ɡlĩm] ‘gleam’ and [klĩn] ‘clean’) and [i] occurring elsewhere (e.g., [lip] ‘leap’). Similarly, the sounds [u] and [ũ] are also in complementary distribution, with exactly the same conditioning environments: [ũ] occurs before [m] and [n] (e.g., [dũm] ‘doom’ and [dũn] ‘dune’), and [u] occurs elsewhere (e.g. [but] ‘boot’). Thus, within each pair, we treat the vowels as allophonic.

We should posit /r/ as the underlying form, and have a rule that devoices it when it occurs after voiceless segments.

Source: Day 6 Handout, Question 1\\

Explain why it is possible to predict whether a plain or aspirated voiceless stop will occur in a new context (in English), but not to predict the place of articulation of a voiceless stop in a new context.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/aspiration.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: There is a pattern to the distribution of plain vs. aspirated stops. Plain stops occur only after [s], while aspirated stops occur only word-initially. So, if I have a new context, I look to see whether the 'blank' is after [s] or after [\#] and predict accordingly. For place of articulation, though, we can't predict, because bilabial, alveolar, and velar stops all occur in identical environments -- so nothing in the environment can help us predict which sound will occur, and so in a new environment, we still don't know.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: We would not expect glottal stop to follow the same pattern. Although all are voiceless stops, these are phonetic characteristics, not phonological features. While [p, t, k] are all [-voice, -continuant], glottal stop is [0cont] so it doesn't fall into the same natural class and wouldn't be expected to follow the same pattern.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Yes, it's possible; in Malto, if there are two stops in a word, they must either both be dental or both retroflex. Since the first sound is dental, the second must also be dental (though to be fair, you couldn't actually predict that it's [d] and not [t], but the question restricts it to only the voiced options).

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The vocal folds vibrate, setting the air coming from the lungs into motion -- this is the "source" sound wave, which is a complex wave, with energy at multiple different frequencies – the fundamental and its harmonics, i.e., its multiples. Then the oral and nasal cavities act as a "filter" to dampen (remove energy from) some of the frequencies of the sound and enhance others (the resonant frequencies). Depending on the shape of the mouth, different frequencies will resonate and so we get different formant values and hence different vowel qualities.

Different: the harmonics are differently spaced, so the fundamental frequency is different, and hence the pitches will be different. In particular, the top one has a LOWER pitch than the bottom one -- its harmonics are closer together, so the fundamental was a lower number to start with.

Explain how each component of the description below gives you information about the sound being described. (Note: it is a single consonant that is being described.)\\

This consonant is characterized by having the adjacent second and third formants “pinched” together; that is, F3 moves down and F2 moves up if you go from a vowel into this consonant. There is often a clear voice bar, but there’s no evidence of formants in the consonant itself. In fact, there’s not much energy during the consonant at all.

This consonant is characterized by having a clear voice bar and its own formants (at around 250 Hz, 2500 Hz, and 3250 Hz). These formants, however, are not as intense as they would be if they were vowel formants.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The first thing to do is a morphological analysis. There should be morphemes that represent each of the four tenses / aspects (present, past, future, and progressive), and morphemes that represent each root. The morphemes representing the tenses appear as (relatively) consistent forms in the columns; the morphemes representing the roots appear as consistent forms in the rows. Doing this reveals that the final 3 segments in the present forms and the final two segments in the progressive forms are suffixes (there are no zero morphemes, and all components have a one-to-one correspondence). Then we check for alternations. The alternations here are in the suffixes; each of the four suffixes has two forms. There are therefore four alternations, with two allomorphs each. So, what we need to analyze are the alternations in the suffix forms, where we see vowels alternating. Two of the alternations involve [i] and [ɯ], and the other two alternations involve [e] and [ɤ]. In each case, there’s a front vowel and a back vowel, which are otherwise matched for height and rounding, so we can likely generalize across the alternations.

Give a good phonological description of the patterns in the dataset that should be analysed.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: For each morpheme that alternates, there are two allomorphs, one with a front vowel and one with a back vowel. The allomorph with the back vowel occurs after another back vowel of the same height (e.g., [fɯd] in [jɤɡɯd-fɯd] ‘swallow, present’ or [sɤ] in [mikɤv-sɤ] ‘search, progressive’), regardless of any intervening consonants. The allomorph with the front vowel occurs elsewhere, including after a front vowel (e.g. [fid] in [sat-fid] ‘chew, present’ or [se] in [sat-se] ‘chew, progressive’) and after a back vowel of a different height (e.g. [fid] in [mikɤv-fid] ‘search, present’ or [se] in [jɤɡɯd-se] ‘swallow, progressive’). Again, these latter environments are regardless of any intervening consonants.

`present tense' and `clean'

\begin{figure}[H]

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: For any morpheme that doesn’t alternate, its UR should be the same as its SR.  For the morphemes that alternate, the back-vowel version occurs in the narrower set of contexts (after a back vowel of the same height), so should be the one that we write a rule for. The front-vowel version occurs in the wider / elsewhere set of contexts (after a front vowel and after a back vowel of a different height), so this should be the UR. So in this case, we have the non-alternating root morpheme ‘clean’ /ŋipɤv/ and the alternating suffix morpheme 'present tense' /ɸið/.

The front-vowel version occurs in the wider / elsewhere set of contexts (after a front vowel and after a back vowel of a different height), so this should be the UR.

{\large Question 7} (completed 20210625) - Topic: Dataset\\
Source: Final Exam Dataset\\

Explain what rule or rules would apply in this dataset and how you know.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: We need a rule of "Vowel Backing" as follows: [α high, +syllabic] --> [+back] / [α high, +back, +syllabic] C0 \_\_. This rule says that a vowel will become back if it follows another back vowel of the same height, regardless of any intervening consonants. We know this is the rule we need because we need to account for the suffix alternations; the suffixes appear either with a front vowel or a back vowel. The back versions occur only after a back vowel of the same height (so are the focus of the rule); the front vowels occur elsewhere (after a front vowel, or after a back vowel of a different height). We could have two separate rules, one for mid vowels and one for high vowels, but this misses the generalization that these rules are basically doing the same thing.


~\\

{\large Question 8} (completed 20210625) - Topic: Dataset\\
Source: Final Exam Dataset\\

Explain what the basic phonological analysis of this dataset is, and what the key pieces of evidence are.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/final_dataset.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The basic analysis here is that vowels of the same height need to agree in terms of backness. We see this in suffix alternations: there are four alternating suffixes, each with a back and front variant, and two of them have high vowels while two of them have mid vowels. Whenever the suffix comes after a root containing a back vowel at the same height as the suffix, the suffix also contains a back vowel, but when the root contains either a front vowel or a back vowel at a different height, the suffix contains the front vowel. Thus, we posit the front versions as the URs of the suffixes, because they occur in the wider set of contexts, and write a rule of vowel backing that only applies when the target vowel follows a back context vowel of the same height.

{\large Question 1} (completed 20210625) - Topic: Phonological Features\\
Source: Day 10 Discussion\\

Explain why phonological features are used instead of phonetic characteristics in analyzing datasets.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Phonological features help to capture phonological patterns, i.e., they group sounds together based on whether they do things like triggering a change or undergoing a change. Phonological features are sometimes language-specific. Phonetic characteristics are simply descriptions of the physical properties of the sounds; they are language-universal and independent of the patterns (though it turns out that many phonological patterns are based on phonetic characteristic groupings).

Explain how you figure out which feature is involved in the process of umlaut shown below.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/dutch.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: we look to see which vowels are affected, and compare them to see which feature is DIFFERENT (not e.g. what features they share); so since the vowels in the singular and plural are identical except that the singular forms are back and the plural are front, it's the feature [back] that is relevant / changing / involved (not e.g. the feature [round] just because all of the vowels are round)

Source: Quiz 9, Question 12\\

Explain the key similarities and differences between the templatic and the rule-based approaches to syllabification.\\


~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: In both, you have rules and the assumption that these rules will get you predictable syllable structure. In the rule-based approach, you ONLY have rules, so you don't know ahead of time what possible syllable types you might get; you also need to know which rules apply in a language and what the order of the rules is -- but in the templatic approach, you have a template that tells you ahead of time what the possible syllable types are, and you use the template in conjunction with rules. In the templatic approach, you also need to know the direction of syllabification (L to R or R to L), not the order of the rules. [Note: should not mention anything about the units used in either approach)

How does syllabification play a role in the analysis of the phonological relationship between tense and lax high vowels in Quebec French?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/quebecfrench.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: here, syllabification must precede the rest of the analysis; the tense vowels ([i] and [u]) occur in open syllables, while the lax vowels occur in closed syllables -- so e.g. we might have a rule of vowel laxing that says [+high, +syll] --> [-tense] / \_\_ C., with a period to specifically mark the syllable boundary in the context of the rule

How does syllabification play a role in the analysis of Tibetan numerals?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/tibetan.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: morphemes that seem to have initial CC clusters (which are visible word-medially, where the CC sequence can be broken up across a syllable boundary) are simplified by deleting the initial consonant when the morpheme occurs word-initially, to avoid complex onsets (perhaps especially because these complex onsets would violate the sonority sequencing principle, which is what makes it hard for students to even imagine that the morphemes have these CC sequences initially!)

Explain why the insertion analysis is better than the deletion analysis for this dataset.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/fula.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: If you have /VC/ as the underlying form of these suffixes, there’s no reason to delete the vowel, because you'd have perfect CV syllables throughout the word. But if you have /C/ as the underlying form, it’s clear that we occasionally need an extra vowel in order to allow syllabification to happen; otherwise, we’d end up with non-syllabifiable CCC sequences. That is, there’s a phonological motivation for the insertion rule, but no motivation for the deletion rule.

Explain which of the three rules will apply to the form given below, and whether each of those rules would have an effect or not.\\

Peng’s Tone-Mapping Procedure for Mende: \begin{enumerate} \item L-to-R association: Associate the first tone to the first TBU, the second tone to the second TBU, and so on, until all tones or all TBUS are exhausted. \item Leftover-tone Linking: Associate any remaining unlinked tones to the last TBU. \item Leftover-TBU Linking: Associate the last tone to any TBU without a tone. \end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: L-to-R association is the only one that applies; it links up each of the three tones to a TBU, and then the other rules have nothing to do, because their context isn't met (there are no leftover tones or TBUs)

Explain how you would figure out the underlying representations of stems in this dataset.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/kukuya.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: We don't see any alternations in this dataset, so we're just looking at static patterns; we don't have completely contrastive examples, but we do have tonal contrasts -- a single-mora root, for example, can be L, H, LH, HL, or LHL (and some of these roots are even segmentally contrastive, too). We see that these are the five basic patterns of tone, and they can get stretched out or squished together, but there are all five, so we assume that these are the tonal invntory. For any actual word, we take its segments and combine it (without associaton lines) with the appropriate tonal category.

Explain how you would figure out the tone-mapping procedures that apply in this dataset.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/kukuya.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You probably start with procedures that you know work for some other language like Mende, and see whether they work here. In this case, we (1) look at cases of words that have one of the contour tones, because words with only H or only L will just always have a single tone associated with all of the TBUs, but contour tones can help you see e.g. “where” the contour happens; (2) look at cases of words with a mismatch in the number of tones and TBUs (e.g. HL tones and VVV, or LHL tones and VV), because these are cases where one-to-one mapping will fail. By seeing that the “tail” of contours is to the left, not the right (e.g., it’s LLH not LHH) and that in the triple-tone words with two TBUs, we have the contour to the left (LH, then L; not L, then HL), we see that the “leftover” stuff needs to be on the left edge instead of the right edge. Hence, the initial mapping procedure should proceed from right to left instead of left to right.

\begin{figure}[H]

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: the suffix morphemes alternate, so we need to pick either one or the other or something else for their URs; because their tone is always predictable from their context, we can assume that they get the tones just from the tone-mapping procedures and are underlyingly toneless (the segments never alternate, so they are the same as in their URs)

INSTRUCTOR NOTES: You probably start with procedures that you know work for some other language like Mende, and see whether they work here; in this case, there's only one underlying tone in each word, and it gets linked to every TBU, so you probably just need something like initial linking and then Leftover-TBU linking (there will never be any leftover tones)
