What is the basic analysis of oral and nasal vowels in this dataset, and what are the key pieces of evidence?\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../images/english12.png}
\end{figure}

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The pairs of sounds [i] and [ĩ], and [u] and [ũ], are each allophonic and therefore allophones of the same phoneme in English (though the two pairs represent two contrastive phonemes in English). The sounds [i] and [ĩ] are in complementary distribution in English, with [ĩ] occurring before the sounds [m] and [n], (e.g., [ɡlĩm] ‘gleam’ and [klĩn] ‘clean’) and [i] occurring elsewhere (e.g., [lip] ‘leap’). Similarly, the sounds [u] and [ũ] are also in complementary distribution, with exactly the same conditioning environments: [ũ] occurs before [m] and [n] (e.g., [dũm] ‘doom’ and [dũn] ‘dune’), and [u] occurs elsewhere (e.g. [but] ‘boot’). Thus, within each pair, we treat the vowels as allophonic.

~\\
INSTRUCTOR NOTES: The pairs of sounds [i] and [ĩ], and [u] and [ũ], are each allophonic and therefore allophones of the same phoneme in English (though the two pairs represent two contrastive phonemes in English). The sounds [i] and [ĩ] are in complementary distribution in English, with [ĩ] occurring before the sounds [m] and [n], (e.g., [ɡlĩm] ‘gleam’ and [klĩn] ‘clean’) and [i] occurring elsewhere (e.g., [lip] ‘leap’). Similarly, the sounds [u] and [ũ] are also in complementary distribution, with exactly the same conditioning environments: [ũ] occurs before [m] and [n] (e.g., [dũm] ‘doom’ and [dũn] ‘dune’), and [u] occurs elsewhere (e.g. [but] ‘boot’). Thus, within each pair, we treat the vowels as allophonic.

L$_X$ (Language X) has three vowels, [i], [a], and [u]. It has bi-syllabic roots like Kikuyu. It does not allow non-identical high vowels to co-occur. Of the following nine logically possible vocalic sequences, which ones should be unattested in L$_X$? Explain why.\\

\begin{itemize} \item {[i...i]} \item {[i...a]} \item {[i...u]} \item {[a...i]} \item {[a...a]} \item {[a...u]} \item {[u...i]} \item {[u...a]} \item {[u...u]} \end{itemize}
